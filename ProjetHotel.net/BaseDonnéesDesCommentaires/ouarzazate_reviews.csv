The bathrooms was large and very clean, and we were gifted the most wonderful set of rose beauty products! The Kasbah has many great spots to drink tea and relax. The food was very good too. The large outdoor pool, surrounded by shaded areas to relax, was very clean too. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. My family and me had the most amazing stay hiking in the area.",5.0
How sad we only had one night here. A stunning Casbah with a beautiful pool. We will return to Morocco and spend more time in this beautiful Kandahar. Highly recommended. The beds we seperate and narrow but got my best nights sleep in Morocco so it was a positive,5.0

They have good Moroccan wine and make their own confiture.  The rooms a spacious, spotlessly clean and furnished in a lovely Moroccan style. Thanks for everything! Felix and Werner",5.0
"We stayed here for 2 nights. The folks in the Damiette family (Mme. Colette, Mr. Yannick and Mr. Erwann) are the most gracious hosts! The entire place was decorated with charming and thoughtful touches inspired by the local architecture. Our room was elegant, spacious and comfortable. The swimming pool surrounded by olives and mint, is a beauty to sit by and sip on some Moroccan tea. Our special and heartfelt appreciation to Mr. Majid and Mr. Redouan. They are part of the wonderful staff and treated us like family during our stay. They were so helpful and a joy to be around! Mme. Colette has magic in her hands. She and her staff whipped up delicious dishes from the kitchen and it was a treat to partake in them. Shukran and au revior!",5.0

What a beautiful place. The family that run the place is adorable. They received us with open arms and heart. The place is so hommy. The food excellent. The swimming pool was amazing. The Terrace. Every corner in the big dar was absolutely beautiful. We had dinner and breakfast and enjoyed them very much. At the time of leaving the all family came to say bye and waved to us. We can feel how much they love what they are doing!,5.0
"This place is incredible.  So much attention to detail.  Totally gorgeous.  Super relaxing. Quiet.  Serene rooftop.  I don't usually swim a lot, but taking a dip after a hot day driving and walking was pretty glorious.  The staff, in particular Majid, were all kind and attentive.  The food was incredible - gourmet, filling, and they took care to accommodate my gluten allergy.  It was sad to leave after one night.  Wish we could have stayed longer!!!",5.0
"This is a wonderful Kasbah in Skoura.  From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, the service was top notch.  The grounds, common areas and rooms were impeccably maintained.  We enjoyed dinner the night we arrived and it was outstanding, we will be hard pressed to find another dinner on this trip to rival the flavours and presentation.  We were also delighted to be offered an excellent Moroccan red wine with our meal.  We also purchased some additional bottles to take along for the rest of our trip.  Breakfast the next morning was also exceptional, crepes, eggs and yogurt, with a delicious array of preserves prepared with fruit from their own trees.  I highly recommend Kasbah Ait Ben Daimette, you will not be disappointed!",5.0
"Our expectations for our trip around Morocco were taken to the next level by staying at this fabulous small hotel. I doubt any riad will live up to this standard. As well as being affordable, it is beautiful, clean, large, comfortable and offers top notch service. The owners have created a genuine oasis with a pool and gardens.  They grow their own fruit and serve lovely preserves with breakfast. We chose to eat dinner there (it is not just a bed and breakfast) and it was the best meal of our trip, with a small wine selection! They even accommodated my need for gluten free food by making me delicious substitutions. Cannot recommend this privately owned hotel highly enough. ",5.0
"My father and I's stay at the Kasbah Ait Ben Damiette was incredible! The Kasbah is an incredible building with beautiful gardens, a pool, lots of nice places to sit and drink tea, a roof where we got to watch the sun set over the oasis, and a restaurant serving delicious food! The staff were very friendly and welcoming! Our room was lovely. In the evening we got to explore the area around the Kasbah, walking through the oasis and getting to meet children coming out of school. The whole stay was a magical experience!",5.0
The family that runs this hotel provided the most wonderful service during our stay.    Add to this the incredible meals they prepared for us and the charming rooms we stayed in and we are so grateful our travels took us through Skoura on the way to the Sahara Desert!!!,5.0
"The family (from Bretagne) that runs this bijoux is lovely, funny, service oriented and runs a great cuisine (kudos to Colette). The place is clean, nicely furnished, has big rooms and set in a great scenery. We made a bike tour with a local guide, that also contributed to the great experience in Skoura. ",5.0
"Staying at this hotel was an amazing experience.  They treated us like family and the owners and all the staff were super friendly. They even washed our car that was covered in mud!  The facilities are excellent.  We had two rooms that were both exquisitely decorated.  We stayed in one of the towers and essentially had the tower all to ourselves.  There is ping pong and petanque (a game like bacci) as well as a nice pool.  The gardens are beautiful, and we ate both dinner and breakfast in the garden.  Collette is an amazing cook!  The food was not only delicious but beautifully presented.  We can't say enough good things about our experience at Kasbah Ait Ben Daimatte!",5.0
"We stayed at this beautiful Kasbah on our way to the desert. We were amazed by the beautiful grounds and service. While the place itself is stunning with a luxurious swimming pool and beautiful gardens, the service made this hotel the best of our whole trip! The French couple who own and run it are as funny as they are gracious and hand cook every delicious meal. Truly a can’t-miss experience!",5.0
My friends and I stayed here for one night when we were heading to Marrakech (from the Sahara Desert).   We highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a charming and beautiful place but still wants to feel like he/she is at home.   Hosts hospitality is definitely the best! They were 100% helpful since the moment we met them.   They prepared us such a tasteful diner and were careful enough to do a different plate for one of our friends who was allergic to some ingredients.  We absolutely loved house’s decoration and the bed is unbelievable comfortable.   Thank you for everything! ,5.0
"We stayed one night here on our way back to Casablanca.  The owners were so welcoming, and make you feel like one of the family.  The rooms are spacious and beautiful.

Highly recommended!",5.0
Very friendly staff! You feel like part of their family. The food is delicious and they accommodate any dietary needs. The rooms are different cities which gives you a feeling of Moroccan nostalgia. It’s truly a hidden gem. ,5.0
"We stumbled on this guesthouse in Skoura and had an absolutely marvellous experience. The traditional rooms are well equipped, clean and comfortable and the common areas are neat, clean and nice atmosphere. We only ate at the hotel for breakfast because we had to be with a group a different hotel and I am sorry we missed out on the food. The kitchen smelled heavenly and the food looked delicious.  The best part of this hotel however is the family that owns it. They introduce themselves and were super friendly. The service was flawless and they greet us whenever we returned and bade us goodbye whenever we departed.  I would love to come to visit for a stay so I can try the food and also to enjoy more time with the family!",5.0
"Set in the dusty streets of Skoura this hotel provides a welcome respite from travel.  Our room, number 14, was large and clean.  The staff were very helpful and friendly and our evening meal was really enjoyable.  We didn't have time to try the pool but it looked inviting.",4.0
"We had the nicest stay with Yannick & Colette and their superb staff team at Kasbah Ait Ben Damiette as part of a longer trip through the Sahara. They've clearly put so much thought into their beautiful guesthouse - the food & wine was delicious, and the house itself feels so peaceful and one-of-a-kind. We wish we could have stayed longer! Would highly recommend if traveling through the area, and I hope to make it back soon.",5.0
"We were warmly greeted by the French family who runs this place.  We had hearty home cooked dinner before we retired to our cosy bedrooms with 4-poster beds. Wifi is very spotty albeit caused by the thick walls. The bed was very comfortable and the sofa in the room was very comfy too. Ben and the service staff was full of initiative, always checking if our plates are empty,  if we have enough hot tea.  Thanks,  Ben, Damiette and everyone at the kasbah.",5.0
My wife and I stayed here for one night during our visit to Morocco and had a wonderful stay. The staff immediately made you feel at home and the room was spacious and charming. The food served was very nice and the goat cheese in particular was something special. It’s a charming kasbah and very comfortable. I would highly recommend it. ,5.0
"We had a perfect stay at Kasbah Ait Ben Damiette. The guesthouse is run by a charming and kind French couple, Colette and Yannick. They were very warm and welcoming and they put a lot of thought into the running of this superb guesthouse. The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Dinner and breakfast were delicious and thoughtfully prepared and presented. Much of the produce comes from their garden. We had a lovely stay thanks to Colette, Yannick, and their wonderful team. Thank you et à bientôt!",5.0
"This was an amazing riad! Great service! We arrived in the evening of our first night in Morocco, after having been driven by our guide from Marrakech Airport across the Tizi n Tichka High Atlas Mountain Pass. It’s very conveniently located near Ouarzazate and Aït Benhaddou. Very friendly French couple and son run the riad, and the other staff are fantastic. Despite the fact that there was a truck strike and no trucks were delivering, a member of the staff drove 5 km before dawn just to buy oranges for our fresh orange juice in the morning. Food is amazing! Great quality, healthy and guaranteed hygiene and food safety. Rooms are extremely clean and so is the riad. Our guide phoned ahead with our estimated arrival time, which meant that our dinner was timed to be ready for us the…",5.0

"Arriving at this tranquil oasis after a long drive from the Sahara desert was perfect. Greeted by the family upon arrival and their attentiveness was like nowhere else we have stayed. Dinner was excellent and we even ended the night with a bottle of wine, staring at the stars on private balcony. Breakfast was filling and tradtional with a french twist, just wish we could have had more time to enjoy this wonderful place.",5.0
"The pictures will show you that the rooms are spotlessly clean and lovely and that the grounds very beautiful and include a pool and many areas to lounge.  What the pictures won't tell you is that the owners are a Moroccan-French family of unparalleled kindness and hospitality, who clearly do all they can to make you feel welcomed and happy with your stay.    We had a lovely meal by candlelight on the terrace.  Only downside:  wifi available only in some places on the ground floor.  Wish we could have stayed longer!",5.0
"After a long day of driving in the heat, we were welcomed by a French-Morrocan family to this lovely and surprisingly lush hotel in the middle of the desert.  I confess that the approach was less than auspicious, but when we drove through the gate, it was as if the heat and dust and harshness melted away.  The photos in TripAdvisor, while accurate, do not really capture how charming this place is (they really should have a professional take the photos for their website).  The pool is a welcome relaxation, as is the rooftop terrace, where we were served complimentary tea and biscuits.  The food was well prepared and near restaurant quality.  And served by candlelight in the intimate courtyard surrounded by lemon (?), fig and palm trees.    All-in-all, it was a wonderful stay. …",5.0
"We stayed here for one night on the way to Marrakech having come from the desert. The Kasbah is wonderful, the rooms are large with a big comfy bed, and the property is decorated beautifully.

Great place to stop on way to the desert. The family that runs the place is wonderful. Nice food and super clean luxury rooms.We had a nice conversation about there history from Breton to Morocco.  Nice pool!,5.0
"When the whole family and staff greet you upon your arrival you know you are in for a treat!  This kasbah knows how to do the extra touches to make your stay memorable. The entrance with a rose garden and fruit trees hides quiet areas for sitting and relaxing. The front facade lit up at night is a sight to behold.  There are many nooks and places in this riad to sit, eat and watch the ever attentive staff go about their duties.  Madam Colette is a magnificent chef and prepares all the meals. We were lucky enough to stay for 2 nights and enjoyed her 4 course dinners.  She readily catered for a vegetarian. Breakfasts were sublime and you can choose where you want to eat and at what time.  The rooms are comfortable and very quiet as this riad is away from the town centre.   The…",5.0

I would highly recommend stopping over and staying at this property.  ",5.0
"The highlight of our stay at this lovely Kasbah was the restaurant.  The meal was truly delicious - Moroccan with a touch of French.  The plates were so attractive  that I spent a lot of my time in Marrakech trying to find them.  The Kasbah has a charming garden as you enter and a nice pool.  The room was spacious and comfortable.  The view from the terrace of the mountains was spectacular, especially at sunset. The legend is that this region used to have a thousand Kasbahs, most of them now in ruins.  It was fascinating learning about the owner's history and how his family recreated this beautiful Kasbah.",5.0
"The kasbah and surrounding area was beautiful!  Everyone -- owners and staff -- was incredibly friendly and nice.  They greeted us upon arrival, took great care of us during our stay, and generally treated us like one of the family.

"We stayed for one night in the Riad as part of a package on our Fes-Marrakech tour, and our expectations were surpassed! The Riad was very nice, with lovely decor and a nice clean fresh vibe. The facilities were great with a large pool to relax at, as well as a high quality of service and lovely meals. We especially liked the food, and would go as far as to say the dinner was one of our favourites during our time in Morocco. Would recommend staying here as part of a tour as it made the trip more enjoyable.",5.0

Privately owned by French couple, this fairly new facility (only 10 year old) featured small walled/secure area, beautiful interior courtyard, pool, and personalized service - we felt like royalty!

No fitness facility ( like all our accomodations on our wonderful Morocco Expert tour vacation.  Room, bed, climate control all great.  Highly recommend and hope to get to visit here again!",5.0
We really enjoyed our stay at this wonderful Kasbah in Skoura. We were part of a group tour and a few of us were lucky to have this place chosen for our stay. The rooms are spacious and immaculately clean and very quiet. The shower was heavenly and lots of hot water to spare. You feel like you are welcomed into their home rather than being lost and ignored at some of the larger hotels and Ryads in the area. Our French hosts -- Colette and Yannick were so friendly and accommodating and would regularly check up on us to offer anything or their assistance. The home made French cuisine was wonderful and we had two lovely dinners and amazing breakfasts in the courtyard outside. An added bonus is the rooftop terrace where you can get a good view of surrounding scenery including the…,5.0
"Great location in Skoura, in the World Heritage listed ‘palmeirias’. Hotel is modelled to look like a ‘kasbah’ - Berber fort. Very comfortable accommodation. Food just average - often watered down version of Moroccan food.",4.0
"     Although we booked in advance based on good reviews, we had some doubts as we approached this hotel on the outskirts of central Skoura in what appeared to be a fairly desolate environment.  Make no mistake, this is a great place to stay.  It has several inviting common areas including a very nice pool, well-tended flower gardens, and great indoor and outdoor places to eat.  Delicious breakfasts are included.  Dinner costs extra and is a little pricey, but you would be well-advised to eat dinner here.  The multi-course candle-lit dinners are really good.  Perhaps the greatest asset is the staff who seem to genuinely enjoy trying to be helpful. Our room was clean, comfortable, and spacious.  The shower was great.

"Lovely oasis Collete and Yakob have built.  Beautiful well maintained little kasbah. They were very inviting and always happy to help. Even though we didn’t speak French or the local language it was never too difficult to communicate what we needed. The hotel itself has authentic architechtire and even a swimming pool which is a rare bonus for the region. The breakfast and dinner was wholesome and they even had alchohol on the menu( again rare in the area). I went for a walk through their local village in the morning, simple rural life and friendly people. Its a family run business and their hospitality was wonderful. They and their efficient staff were very sweet with our two young boys(9 and 5) and even though they didn’t share the same language the warmth spoke for itself.…",5.0

The service was exquisite (you could tell the owners care a lot - and come out to greet you!), the rooms were exceptional (quaint, yet somehow elegant), the views were special, and the floorplan just...special.

The only glitch was the wifi was spotty in our room (fine in our daughters'), and the a/c in our room wasn't great. Opening the windows to let in the desert breeze helped a lot. Lovely place!",5.0
"The rooms are nice and the breakfasts are great with many options.  The place is run by a lovely French couple.  The dinners were almost as great as the breakfasts.  Overall a very nice experience and the staff were excellent.  However, we are hugely disappointed because they promised to send us a recipe and it has not happened.  They promised but did not follow through. ",3.0

"Kasbah Ait Ben Damiette’s rooftop patio provides a pleasant sunset and sunrise panorama of the Skora Palmerie with the backdrop of High Atlas Mountains. Our room was comfortable with adequate air conditioning. They have a large pool that would have been nice to use, especially after the long drive to get to the Kasbah. However, apparently after a somewhat recent rain, the pool was filthy and unusable. We were disappointed not to be able to use the pool and didn’t find any other activities in the area. The owners were out of the country when we visited, which may have affected staffing. I would not recommend this hotel to a friend.",3.0
"What a wonderful place to stay! Certainly was one of the highlights of my Moroccan trip. The owners, Colette and Yannik were very gracious hosts and their staff very accomodating. It is a beautiful restored kasbah with large comfortable rooms and interesting decor. Great pool area to relax and enjoy the beautiful weather. The owners are french and their cuisine is wonderful. Quite a change from the typical tangines of the country. Breakfasts and dinners were excellent and plentiful. I would highly recommend staying here on your way to Marrakech.",5.0
"We spent two nights here during a recent trip to Morocco. What a wonderful oasis! Though it does feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, that's the beauty - you really don't need anything else! The wonderful hosts were there to greet us and get us settled into our spacious room. Good air conditioning helped keep things cool but there are screens on the windows which helped keep bugs out when we did want to open them. Nice bathroom, though at first the drain for the shower went down very slowly, which they immediately fixed. Gorgeous pool to lounge around along with a nice bottle of Rose. The best part was the food - wonderful change from having tagine every day! The French influence was tasted in every bite. Breakfast and Dinner was amazing! I would recommend this location…",5.0
"This kasbah was one of the highlights of my two-week trip to Morocco.  The owners, Collette and Yannik are wonderful hosts.  You can see their attention to detail in the restored kasbah, its furnishings and decorations.  The food was excellent and a departure from the typical Moroccan fare.  Their use of fresh herbs, vegetables, French-inspired cuisine made dinner an event.  The rooms are large and very comfortable with separate seating areas and high ceilings. Also, the pool area is very pleasant for lounging in the desert heat.",5.0
"This place is so wonderful and serene. You can lounge near the pool, various gardens, quiet common rooms, or even near the bocci/ping pong gaming area. Yannick, Collette, and their lovely staff will make you feel at home. In fact, you will never want to leave. I can't wait to come back!  Note: they do sell wine and beer. Be sure to have cash on hand because at this time, they do not have a credit card reader. There is a bank/atm in town if you need it. ",5.0
"We stayed here as part of a tour through the Atlas Mountains, and it was a lovely surprise how nice it was. The room was absolutely beautiful, with lots of space and light, very clean and extremely comfortable. We ate dinner and breakfast and both were superb meals, a good mix of simple, accomplished cooking and particularly authentic Moroccan touches. We even got to taste a bit of Moroccan wine for the only time in our two-week stay in the country, and it was really good!   On top of this, the kasbah has been built using traditional methods - you can feel the adobe walls, and see that a lot of thought has gone into its design.   Would definitely return, a really lovely place. ",5.0
I can't recommend Kasbah Ait Ben Damiette highly enough.  What a wonderful oasis.  The food was out of this world.  The room was large and beautifully done. Yannick and Collette's hospitality was extraordinary.  ,5.0

Dinner and breakfast were served in the beautiful gardens while we were there. The terrace provides unparalleled views of the palm grove. ",5.0

They greeted us with a warm hug upon our arrival and wished us a good bye in the same way. The place was a true Oasis in the desert.  A beautifully decorated and spacious room with a view on a lovely courtyard and an olive tree garden.  The food was amazing – Moroccan French fusion lovely presented and served in beautiful garden surroundings.  The hosts along with all the staff made our stay very pleasurable and memorable. Definitely one of the jewels during our trip made especially memorable by our hosts and their staff.",5.0

We were staying at Aït Ben Damiette for 2 nights. We were welcomed like family. The whole staff is like a big whole family.   The kasbah has been rebuilt to its old splendour !!! Much effort has been put by Yannick and Collette and their whole staff !!!  The food is a melting pot between moroccan and french (Bretagne) cuisines.   Many thanks for letting us stay in such a beautiful place !   It's easy to choose Damiette again on another visit to Skoura !!!  ,5.0

This place shows how a family runs a hotel as if hosting friends. Its run by a lovely couple who followed their dream of building a Kasbah with local materials and builders and provide a million course meal French style. Nearby to visit is the famous Kasbah Amridil made from mud and straw which is a highlight of any Morocco tour. ,4.0
This is a lovely place with absolutely lovely people and delicious food. They make you feel right at home and will do whatever they can to make you comfortable. Yannick and Collette (the owners) stood outside waving goodbye to us as we pulled away.  So very sweet. ,5.0

"We stayed here toward the end of our trip. We were all getting very tired and crabby from all the driving, and we decided to ""rest and relax"" on this day. It happened to be here, this beautiful hotel. We all hung by their breathtaking pool, had some of their delicious mint tea, and caught up on the news with their free WiFi. The staff was AWESOME.  In the evening, we had dinner at their cozy, sweet restaurant and loved the food. Aside from being delicious, it was presented with flair and attention to detail.  This property is really wonderful, and kind of in the middle of the nowhere. The rooms have great views and are dramatic with canopy beds and curtains. The bathrooms are large and nice. It takes a while for the hot water go get to the rooms, which are spread out a bit, but…",5.0
"We loved our night at this beautiful kasbah on the drive between the Atlas Mountains. The owners are incredibly kind and friendly, the rooms are lovely with big comfortable beds, warm clean showers and fast wifi, the garden is perfect and the food was delicious. Feels like we were transported to a Morocco of the past. ",5.0
"Skoura presents the traveller with a chance to experience a Moroccan palmerie, or palm-filled oasis, and to explore the small, remote villages surrounding it.  The town itself isn't particularly prepossessing, and the Kasbah Ait Ben Damiette is an island of welcome quiet and comfort on the edge of Skoura.  The staff of the Kasbah couldn't be more attentive.  The rooms are large, clean and well appointed.  There's a swimming pool, table tennis, a bocce court, and well-kept garden within the Kasbah walls.  The food's top drawer Moroccan.   The place to stay, if Skoura's the stop.",5.0
"We stayed only 1 night at this beautiful hotel. Our room was up in one of the towers and was beautifully decorated; four-poster bed, oriental lamps and enough blankets to keep warm.  The dinner was great: Moroccan cuisine the French way. Every dish was beautifully made up and very appetizing. The breakfast too was abundant and we especially liked the different home-cooked fruitjams with the three different kind of pancakes and pastries. Delicious. The staff were very friendly.   I would strongly recommend this hotel to everyone.",5.0
"Our very own castle! Although tagines in Morocco are delicious, we were kind of tired of them after a week. But the cook here was simply amazing! We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and breakfast. Sunset was amazing up on the roof. Service staff were excellent too! :)",5.0

"This place is one of the highlights of our holiday in Morocco. Both the owner were very lovely and went extra miles to ensure we enjoyed our stay. They asked each of my children what to eat for dinner, took time to play with them and make sure we were comfortable. And Rezwan the manager was faultless. He was always smiling and very polite. Nothing's too difficult for him. Very very pleasant gentleman. And the food, oh where do I start. Plate after plate after plate of very delicious and authentic Moroccan cuisine. We cannot resist to compliment the chef herself.  The room was huge! Decorated beautifully. Authentic and really comfortable.  All in all the place and service was truly exceptional. It's truly a gem. Go ahead and book. You won't be disappointed.  The only downside is…",5.0
"My daughter and I stayed one night in this beautiful Riad. Mfr the rod it looks like nothing, but when we arrived and went inside we were amazed at the beautiful accommodations. We were greater by the French husband and wife owners and their attentive staff. Our room was enormous with two twin beds and a sitting area with two couches. The bathroom was big as well with a shower and commode in separate areas. The food was outstanding for both dinner and the complimentary breakfast. We asked to see the chef because we wanted to compliment her personally. Our stay at the Kasbah Ait Ben Dimette  was one of the highlights of our trip to Morocco. ",5.0
"Want to stay in a Moroccan Castle? This beautifully built and decorated hotel building offers value for money, great food and a hospitable welcome at a location close to Skoura Palm Grove (40 mins drive).

We are arrived at this Kasbah late in the afternoon after a very long drive and were warmly welcomed by Collette and Yanick.  Our rooms were spacious and charming and after a few cocktails on the patio (they had no problem that we brought them with us) we went in for dinner.  I have to say that we had many wonderful meals in Morocco but dinner at this Kasbah was one of the best.  You will really appreciate the French influence after many tagines and kabobs.  A delightful place to spend the night!,5.0
We were en route to the deep desert from Merrakech and spent the night here.  Everything was arranged by Authentic Morrocan Tours. After a dusty day this place is truly an oasis.  The room is spacious and clean.  The shower large and hot.  There is also a pool if you want to take a swim.  The food is good and the service is fantastic!  Which ever tour operation you choose I would request this place if you are going into the deep desert,5.0
"Collette and Yanick are warm and loving hosts who produce excellent, healthy food and care about your diet. They will adapt what they serve to your needs. It is rare for me to be served gluten-free cake and crepes. Okay, not rare... it has never happened ! Until I came to Kasbah Ait Ben Damiette. It is clear that this Kasbah is a labour of love and they treat everyone who crosses their threshold as though they are family. We will return to this beautiful place again.",5.0
"The staff here are exceptionally hospitable and warm.  The rooms are spacious and beautiful.  The dinner we had there was one of the best we've had in our two weeks in Morocco.  Although it was cold when we were there, the grounds of the Kasbah are landscaped nicely, and I can only imagine how relaxing it would be to use the pool and the back yard area!",5.0
"I've stayed all over Morocco but I have to say the staff in Kasbah Ait Ben Damiette were the best I've ever encountered!  The Building and the gardens are magnificent!  Site seeing in the area was almost unlimited, the best Oasis and Kasbahs I've ever seen. ",5.0
"I  last visited [and reviewed] this hotel in spring 2015, and was even more impressed this visit.  The food is still gourmet and beautifully served, and wine is available.  I was there leading a tour and one person didn't eat meat - they were notified ahead and made her fish.  But another was lactose intolerant and thought she'd just 'manage.'  Colette didn't accept that, and made her two special dishes to replace those with lactose.  For example, instead of milk she added soy milk [near the Sahara?!] to her pumpkin soup.  Also there is now wifi in all the rooms, not just the lobby.  Lovely, quiet, delicious place to stay.",5.0
From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome by the charming french couple who run this hotel. They tended to our every need even making a tisane to help treat a nasty cold! Our room was magnificent and the meals were delicious. Highly recommended. We will return for a longer stay next time!,5.0

"This truely is an ""Oasis"" in the desert, you are made to feel welcome the moment you drive through the gates. The owners, Collette & Yannack, along with all the staff made our stay the most enjoyable & memorable of our 7 week adventure across Europe. The food is sensational, the service is fantastic,  the rooms are so well appointed. You will want for nothing here, or only to stay longer. Enjoy the gardens, pool, table tennis, boules,  We had a cooking lesson which was so much fun and hands on, after which we sat in the beautiful garden and ate our wonderful French Moroccan cuisine.   We felt like old friends, and wold have stayed longer if we could have.",5.0
"Place was very nice and upscale but still had traditional Moroccan feel. Stayed one night as a part of a tour. We had the entire riad to ourselves, as September isn't the high season, so they treated us as such, but with its location and super  friendly staff I feel they'd treat everyone that way.",5.0
"We unfortunately only spent 1 short night here en route between the Erg Chigaga dunes and Fes, but wow, what a night.  The staff were amazing, the grounds were unparalleled, and the food was the best we tasted on our trip.  I'd go out of my way to go back.",5.0
"This kasbah is great. After a long drive over the Atlas mountains, this was the place to visit. The hotel itself is beautiful with an amazing pool. The pool is a bit cold, which is amazing when it is 40+ degrees out in the summer.   We opted to have dinner at the kasbah. The chef is amazing. They served a 5 course Moroccon inspired French dinner. Each bite was great.   The room we stayed in (the Marrakesh room) is huge. It has a great sitting area (with cookies) and a lovely bed. My only complaint is that the AC is a bit weak for the size of the room, but that is probably because we stayed in July - I would recommend a cooler season. ",5.0
"I stayed two nights in June having booked by phone. This hotel was recommended by friends and it did not disappoint. Rebuilt six years ago using local building techniques this is spectacular accommodation. My room was clean and comfortable and had an en-suite bathroom, air conditioning and WiFi. I really liked it. Apparently none of the rooms have TV.   The swimming pool is big and just what is needed by the weary traveler.   The hotel is owned and run by French retirees Colette and Yannick and their staff. They are all very helpful and pride themselves on their hospitality. Very good customer service. They recommended I do the bicycle tour (210 dhs for 4 hours) of the palmerie. They arranged this and I would recommend anyone visiting for the first time to do it. Fascinating. …",5.0
"My husband and I spent overnight on our way from Marrakesh to the Saharah at Kasbah Ait Ben Damiette.  Even though it's a pass through, this beautiful kasbah and its staff left us a feeling that we don't want to leave.  It has beautiful gardens, swimming pool, patio, which all make you feel cool in 45 degrees.  Praises go to all the staff, owners, manager, hospitality and chef.  They came out to welcome you and see you off  when you leave.  It's heart warming!  Room is spacious and bed comfortable.  You wake up only with bird singing.  Would definitely recommend!",5.0

"We decided to stop on our way back to Marrakech from the Dades/Todra gorges, and chose Skoura as a relaxing-looking place. We were so glad we did, if only because we got to stay at Kasbah Ait Ben Damiette and meet the most charming hosts of our whole trip; the French owners, Colette and Yannick, and their wonderful manager Redouane. They were the highlight! The perfect hosts (helpful, attentive, but not intrusive), so warm and welcoming, very patient with our minimal French (and Redouane speaks perfect English when you need a translator!), simply lovely to chat to.   The kasbah itself is also gorgeous. Right out in the palmeraie, so very peaceful; a large pool to relax by; clean and tastefully decorated rooms, and the food (both dinner and breakfast) was divine. Book now!",5.0
"We stopped here on our route from Marrakech to the Sahara Dunes. I can't think of any other reason to be in this part of the country other than to hike the Gorges. The French owners are beyond lovely and welcoming, as is the staff. The renovation of this kasbah has clearly been a labor of love. The bathrooms are very basic, but the rooms are lovely and the food is a wonderful combo of French and Moroccan. Breakfast and dinner are included. There is a lovely pool. We walked around the oasis and felt very safe.",4.0

The moment we arrived, we were greeted by the owners. They speak little English but there hospitality is overwhelming. They gave us a choice of room, both were wonderful. Spacious rooms, comfortable, toiletry gifts.   In the evening you gather at the outside oven to watch you bread being made before sitting down to the most amazing French food with Moroccan influence.

"The hotel is amazing from the outside and the pool area is nice, but from the inside it feels a little artificial and not very authentic. While I don´t know for sure, it does feel like this is not actually an old kasbah but a new building styled as a kasbah. Food was ok, portions were on the small side though. Unfortunately they only speak French so it can be a bit tough to communicate.  Overall a nice hotel, but we felt the price was way too high compared to other hotels we stayed in and wasn´t justified. The premium price just wasn´t matched by a premium experience.",3.0

Every time we turned, another small, little garden or dining area instead and out.  Not to mention the meals..  Dinner was amazing.  Course after course, so pretty and so delicious.

I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with any aspect of a stay at this beautiful place.  From the warm welcome from Yannick, Collette and Redouane upon our arrival to the goodbye waves when we left, they could not have done more to ensure that we had a perfect stay.  Our room, high up in one of the towers with a private patio offering views over the palmerie and the distant Atlas mountains, was spacious, tastefully decorated, and very comfortable.

Redouane looked after us perfectly and the choice of music was great fun too. Happily recommend it to others and hope to return to Skoura (take a bike ride, it's fascinating).",5.0
"A true oasis of peace and tranquility.  Our only complaint is that we had so little time to enjoy the beautiful surroundings, because our guide brought us here after a long day of traveling. What made this inn truly unique was the remarkable attention and kindness of the proprietors Collette and Yannick.  We wished that we spoke French so that we could have conversed more freely with them--they were so helpful, funny, and sweet.  We had the impression that they truly care about every guest.  The food was fantastic, the beds very comfortable.  Could not have asked for more.",5.0

We stayed one night at ""our home"" with the lovely, French owners, Collette and Yannick, and their ever present helpful and friendly staff members. We really did feel like we were ""coming home"" after a long road trip, as we were greeted in the driveway by all mentioned, our bags whisked to our room, and hospitality seemingly permeating the air.   The ""Kasbah"" in a word is stunning!  Only six years old, with modern amenities but lovely traditional appointments with Moroccan-style decorations, pictures, furniture, and attention to detail everywhere!

"Rarely do I wax ecstatic about a hotel or inn I've frequented. But on very rare occasions I come to a place which from the moment of arrival until the moment of departure welcomes me, makes me feel at home - and yet pampered - and, as I leave, imprints me with the urge to return.And this very special home had precisely that effect on my wife and me. As we drove up, Collette came out to greet us and in no time had us settled in a glorious airy room, subtly and tastefully decorated, served with an afternoon tisane and completely painlessly checked in. During the next two days my rudimentary French got a healthy workout with Collette and Yannick - there was no problem being understood in English as well, courtesy of the friendly and supprotive staff. And we were then free to relax…",5.0

The setting is also lovely with wonderful gardens. We only regretted that our time there was way too short.",5.0
"We LOVED this hotel! Run by a French couple, the “Kasbah,” which seemed to have only about a dozen rooms or so, is a new building in the style of an ancient kasbah. Although the owners do not speak English, members of the staff do and they were able to translate for us. The owners are so charming and eager to please. Our room was large and beautiful with a large bathroom and a lovely gift box that included cleanser, shampoo, etc. We were asked what we wanted to eat in advance of each meal and if we wanted to sit in the dining room indoors, the patio or garden. Collete, the owner and cook, accommodated our special dietary needs and emphasized that she was pleased to be able to do so for anyone with special dietary requirements. Everything was perfect!",5.0

The Riad was beautifully kept, peaceful and relaxing with equally warm and friendly staff.  The food was top restaurant standard, and overall we loved this place.  A welcome respite as a stop off between the desert and the mountains.",5.0
"The Riad was very homey and mostly empty due to the time of year, mid-December, we were there. As a result we received very personal and welcoming service. Our room was large with windows looking out on the cactus and rose garden. The food was purely delightful French gourmet cooking each night.  Our hosts, a husband and wife, were French. They were French speaking which is common in Morocco, however, neither my husband nor myself spoke French. Our driver spoke French so we were covered while he was with us. After he left, our hosts and we engaged in a kind of pantomime to make our desires known. We both must have been really good at it because our wishes were granted. We stayed 3 nights and felt very warmly welcomed during our stay.",5.0

"I was stunned when my friends and I pulled up into this beautiful oasis after driving for many hours into what seemed like the middle of nowhere. This amazing hidden gem was just what we needed to recharge after our first few exhausting days in Morocco. The rooms were beautifully decorated and most importantly air conditioned! We were given a wonderful five course meal cooked by the adorable French couple that run this hotel. It was probably the best meal I had while I was in Morocco! It was a bit too cold to take a dip in the pool that evening, but it didn't stop us from putting our feet in and drinking a couple glasses of wine. The following morning we were up early to get back on the road, but not before we had breakfast, which was equally as amazing as our dinner. As excited…",5.0
"Have to agree that Collette and Yanick and crew deserve the accolades. As with a previous reviewer, we arrived feeling very much under the weather and only looking for a cool place to sleep.  Collette's oregano tea helped immensely and we only wish we could have enjoyed the food, but due to our ""situation"" all we could really do is look. Presentation,  smell and what little we could manage to eat were all excellent. Would be very happy to return should our path ever lead this way again, Thanks again Collette, we drank a lot of the oregano tea!!",5.0
"We received a very personal and warm welcome from the French couple who own and run this lovely hotel, which is an oasis of calm at the edge of the Sahara desert. Stunning old building, carefully restored to an excellent standard ...with very inviting swimming pool.  Beautifully crafted and maintained grounds. And the food, the food: wow, fantastic! Service was unobtrusive but very attentive; overall the impression was as if we were regular visitors, well regarded and much loved. I was unwell because of something I ate before arriving at the Ben Damiette (definitely nothing to do with this hotel), and the owners were seriously concerned for my welfare and actively accommodated my condition: they prepared food specially for me, and allowed us to stay an extra night at a…",5.0
"This redone kasbah has a lovely pool, rooms decorated with much attention to detail, and a very welcoming French couple as hosts. Although they don't speak English, or just a little, they have made special efforts to always have a Moroccan assistant present who does. But for me the outstanding feature is the multi-course French meals, served very elegantly with, for example, pomegranate or oleander blossoms on the plate. I was leading a group tour during which we visit out-of-the-way places. The previous night had been spent at a rustic hotel in the desert, and the group was thrilled with the contrast in cuisine they found at Kasbah Ait Ben Damiette. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I'm an anthropologist and prefer a bit more 'ethnographic' decor. But you can't…",4.0
"This was a lovely place to stay and the French hosts were so enthusiastic and welcoming. Our room was lovely and the facilities were spacious and varied. There was a large garden with many places to sit, a large pool where we had drinks every night. Be aware that it is generally too expensive to heat the pools so they are often too cool to swim. There was a roof deck with a view of the sunset. The breakfasts featured many homemade items including jams breads and also local honeys. There was always plenty to eat and they served eggs on request. The dinners were lovely, plentiful and all cooked by Madame. She is a very good cook. One caveat to staying here is the payment process. We sent a deposit in via Paypal  and the remainder of the payment was due on check out in cash…",4.0

Colette and Yannick were once again the perfect hosts in every way, providing fabulous food and genuine hospitality, even producing a beautiful birthday cake for one of our party and a gift. Their Manager, Mahfoud, was also very friendly and helpful, everything being served with a big smile. I have no hesitation in…",5.0
"My husband and I and 3 of our children spent the night here as a stopover between Marrakech and the Sahara desert. It was such a memorable stay for all of us. The owners, Yannick and Collette and also Malfoud were exceptional hosts. Moroccan tea by the pool listening to jazz while our children played ping pong and bocce, watching the woman bake bread for our dinner, and our evening ended with a fantastic French Moroccan meal under the stars. Breakfast was beautiful and delicious. We enjoyed talking with Yannick and Colette and also Malfoud about their lives. Traveling for us is not just about the places we visit, but of the people we meet.  Thank you all for such a lovely stay in your beautiful Kasbah! We hope to return someday! ",5.0
"We stayed at Kasbah Ait-Ben-Damiette for just one night in April 2015.  But it was such a memorable few hours, that we wished we had stayed longer, much longer. Because of the extraordinary warmth and constant attention of the owners Colette and Yannick. As well as the perfect professionalism of Malfoud, the manager. We stayed in the Marrakech suite, a big comfortable room, which felt more like home than a hotel. We had all three meals there: breakfast, lunch and dinner. Colette and Malfoud asked us our preferences in detail for each meal. And when the meal arrived at the table, voila, it was Heaven! A customized French-Moroccan fusion meal. Which was a really welcome change from tajine-and-couscous-and-broquet meals. Skoura itself is a glorious place for exploring this very…",5.0
"The owners of the kasbah, Colette and Yannick,  not only are the most welcoming and warm hosts that we found all over Morocco, but they are also perfectionists in nature, which reflects in the minimum details, from the confort of the rooms to the good taste all over, from the good music by the pool to  the excellent cuisine, not to mention the bread, the best we had during our stay in Morocco. It is a duty and a pleasure to recommend this hotel.",5.0

Colette is an accomplished cook who expresses her love through her preparations.  Wifi is a little weak, but then again, maybe that's a good thing.",5.0
"Yannick and Colette are the perfect hosts - warm, charming, friendly, accommodating. The rooms are spacious and beautifully furnished. However the real highlight of our stay here was the food. Aware that by the time travellers reach Skoura they might be seeking a break from tagines and couscous, Colette prepares a dinner which is an imaginative and delicious fusion of French and Moroccan cuisine. For breakfast, one is treated to a selection of Colette's homemade conserves - the pumpkin and orange jam was sensational. Thanks to Around Morocco Tours for organising our stay here.",5.0
"My husband, 6 year old son, and I stayed at this hotel for only 1 night but we wish we could have stayed longer. We received the warmest and most hospitable service we have ever experienced (and we travel a lot). The hotel itself is beautiful, comfortable, and relaxing. It felt like a mix of French countryside and colorful Morocco. We arrived a little late but we were greeted by the owners and their helper. They had dinner ready for us which was delicious. Breakfast was also great. We were treated as if we were visiting family and you can tell that the owners love what they do. By the time we left (less than 24 hours) we felt sad to go. Even my husband said he felt sad as if he was leaving family. They personally walked us out and waved until we were out of site. The hospitality…",5.0

Our rooms were spacious and very beautifully done with lovely bathroom products and biscuits to sample. We were offered tea and sat in the main room and chatted with the hosts. Supper was dish after dish of delicious food - fusion of French and Moroccan. Quiet rooms, comfortable beds and good bed linen etc. Breakfast was delicious with 5 different types of bread and cake, a selection of home made preserves - I recommend the sweet potato.

One of the highlights of our trip was to spend a night at the Kasbah Ait Ben Damiette www.kasbahaitbendamiette.com .  It was recommended to us by our host at the desert camp (Liz Williams from Authentic-Morocco) and OMG are we ever glad we took her up on her recommendation.     To conjure up the right image of this little Kasbah, think of a French couple (Collette & Yanik) from France... who have authentically restored a small castle in Moroccan style and then added a fantastic French menu to the experience. So not only do you get great authentic accommodations and food, but you get the very rare benefit of proprietors who truly care…",5.0

Our hosts Colette and Yanik were extremely nice and prepared meals fit for a pacha! Big thank you! We highly recommend this riad.",5.0
"One of our only regrets about our trip to Morocco was not being able to stay here longer.  The French couple that runs the Kasbah are as warm and welcoming as you could ever hope for.  We couldn't get over how insanely well-kept the property was. The town surrounding the Kasbah is quite peaceful, we stayed here on our way from the Sahara to Mt. Toubkal and it felt like quite a luxurious oasis in the midst of our long drive. One last note, they take extreme pride in the food they serve here so come prepared to eat!  Breakfast was quite Moroccan but dinner was like a 5 course French meal with Moroccan influences, really amazing.",5.0
"After a day's drive from Marrakech, the flower garden in the front and the sunny pool adjacent the large palmeraie provided the perfect rest and relaxation. A gorgeous place that looks like a castle or a fort - but is not ancient. It was built around 1950 and was recently renovated. The rooms are large and luxurious but a bit cold dring our visit at the yearend -the aircon/heating unit malfunctioned at one of our family's three rooms, so we needed triple blankets to stay warm.  Yannick and Colette who own the place are very friendly and hospitable - Colette is a formidable cook. The dinner was excellent as was the breakfast.

The dining rooms, garden tables and pool are are beautiful and comfortable. Her food is just excellent, from soups to desserts and everything in between. A local woman cooks bread in an outdoor oven every night and we enjoyed watching this tasty endeavor.

"Stayed for 2 nights whilst travelling round the area. I understand that it's a popular stopping off point for a lot of smaller tours heading out to the desert or around the Atlases, so most people only stay for one night, but it's definitely worth stopping for two nights or more to explore some of the local area.   Rooms are spacious, and there's ample wifi and lots of communal areas, including a huge pool and roof terrace, which has great views of the surrounding areas in all directions. The mini-fridges in the rooms were a nice touch, and something we didn't encounter too often, but was great to store our other drinks.

The room, the amenities, the little gifts of rose-water products, and the FOOD! Did I mention the food - it was the best we encountered in a two-week trip throughout Morocco.

"We enjoyed a one night stay here last week; I can't add much to other comments, but as to the dinner I found that it was pleasant, with some interesting side dishes and vegetable preparations  (though the initial course of two small servings of soups was very good). Breakfast however was the best we had in 18 days in Morocco (Riads mostly): the Yogurt was local and fresh and seved with some unique and flavorful preserves; the breads were also delicious. The room was spacious, comfortable and quiet; the hostess/chef and host are most gracious, the hotel surroundings are beautiful, and we were able to use the hotel as the jumping off point for a very nice walking tour to Casbahs in the area. This is a very relaxing travel alternative.",5.0

Our waiter/guide Mustafa was fabulous. A great two night stay and bar far the best accommodation we had in our week trip.",5.0

"The beautifully decorated, and spotlessly clean, Kasbah reflected the tranquility of the surrounding oasis, but it was Colette and Jannick's warmth, perfectionism and passion for hospitality that made our stay so special - it is the only hotel I have ever stayed in so unique I feel compelled to return one day.  They treated us like royalty, organising tours, taxis, even packing us a lunch for the journey home.  Colette's gourmet cooking is a special treat for a vegetarian, providing a varied menu each day.  A personal highlight for me was watching the bread be made in the Kasbah's own wood fired oven. I would also strongly recommend the tour of the oasis, as it adds context and a story to the region and it's mud brick castles.",5.0
"From the moment I arrived Colette and Yannick could not have done more to help. Even the language barrier didn't cause too many issues. I was asked if I had any special requests food wise and when dinner came I was more than pleasantly surprised,four courses were served to the highest standard and this was repeated on my second night. Colette went out of her way to find me an English speaking guide to show me around the Palmerie, Amit made this a very interesting tour. Superb facilities and fantastic hosts.",5.0
"We had the pleasure of visiting the Kasbah in July for a day.  It is absolutely beautiful,  spotless, modern with lush gardens, traditional furnishings and a lovely pool.  The contrast of this kasbah with the surrounding areas is drastic and a refreshing change. We enjoyed an artisticly presented and tasty 7 course lunch on the setees in the shade beside the pool. Wish we could have stayed longer than just the day.    Our hosts were very accomodating and their exacting high standards for their guests were very evident.  They very obviously loved restoring this kasbah and had worked hard to include and benefit the community.  Moroccco during Ramadan is a bit spotty for service so this kasbah run by a french couple was a welcome relief. Thank you Collette and Yannick!",5.0
"The fact that we came upon this beautiful place quite by chance made it all the more exciting!  A Kasbah built and decorated in the colours & style of old Morocco, run by French couple Colette &Yannick.  We were warmly welcomed and treated like personal guests. For dinner our host Yannick served us a gourmet, multi- course Moroccan-French meal,  with unique culinary creations made by Colette using fresh ingredients from the garden. Dinner was served in the front garden and breakfast by the deep blue pool with the sounds of music drifting across from poolside speakers. Lounge chairs, cushions, curtains and bedspreads were all in exquisite, carefully chosen fabrics and the photos of local people & places taken by Colette herself.  An exceptional place with exceptional hosts!!",5.0
"Excellent fixed up kasbah, in-room a/c  roof patio and pool. Husband/wife owners ooze charm and hospitality without smothering. Collette cooks amazing dinners. The kasbah is far enough out of Ouarzazarte to truly experience rural Atlas Mountains, enroute to Dades Gorge. A great place to base out of.",5.0
"Amazing hospitality by Colette and Yannick. They are wonderful hosts and no detail is too small to notice and take action on. They are incredibly thoughtful and made our visits - we stayed there for two non-consecutive nights - an absolute pleasure.  To give you an idea of how good they are: When we visited we were greeted effusively by both and given tea and coffee and biscuits. Luggage was taken promptly to the room.  We are vegetarian and this can be tough in Morocco. Colette arranged a number of absolutely delicious vegetarian meals. More to the point, there were no tajines at all. And this was deliberate. As she explained - and this was so true!! - if you are vegetarian in Morocco everyone gives you a vegetable tagine. She figured we were probably sick of this and so gave…",5.0
"Our photography tour from Strabo tours brought us to this wonderful and beautiful Kasbah in Skoura.  Not only are the surrounding wonderful but the meals prepared by Collette are outstanding !! She actually gave me the receipe for one of her superb soups translated to English by their charming houseboy.  A highlight was watcing a bread demo in a stone oven.  From demo to table 13 min, wonderful hot bread, just can't beat it.  We stayed 2 nights, the rooms were clean and charming.  Collette and Yannik were so welcoming and made the entire experience one I will never forget.  I hope others traveling to Morocco will make Kasbah Ait Ben Damiette part of their travel experience also.",5.0
"A real gem.  we stayed for 2 nights (one of 5 places we stayed on our trip).  we would have been quite happy staying for longer.  the facilities are great, including an lovely pool; the food is excellent - as  good as we had in Morocco; and the welcome is wonderful.  Nothing is too much trouble -  Yanick and Colette's assistant was really helpful, taking us to Skoura to get the puncture on our hire car repaired.  Don't miss the Dades Gorge.  We just need an excuse to return!",5.0
"Spent one night at this beautiful Kasbah and it was an oasis of style, comfort, and culinary delight.  Yanick and Colette are very welcoming and you can feel their love for the place and their guests.  The food was amazing including the bread made in the outdoor fire oven.  Breakfast was also fantastic.  I only wished we had spent more than one night.  Would love to come back. Highly recommend.",5.0
"We spent one night in Kasbah ait ben Damiette in April 2013-- booked by our tour company.  We were utterly charmed by the beautiful setting, the gorgeous room, and the amazing food.  Had a terrific French/ Moroccan multi-course dinner and a spectacular breakfast with all manner of pastries, breads, jams, and spreads, all home-made.  Would love to come back when it is warmer and take advantage of the gorgeous pool.  Unfortunately didn't have time to explore the village either, although the drive in was gorgeous.  The owners were patient with my limited English and they have a staff member from the village who learned English though a Peace Corps volunteer when he was in school and speaks very well.",5.0
"We stayed one night in Kasbah ait ben Damiette as part of a tour through eastern Morocco. This was in April 2013. The hotel was delightful. The rooms were nice.  The owner is a gourmet cook and the food was excellent, although one of our party was vegan and she had a difficult time getting a vegan dish. The breakfast was superb. The owners are French and don't speak English, but one of the Moroccan staff speaks English quite well. The owners are exceptionally friendly people.",5.0
"We (2 adults and 3 children) stayed here in March 2013.  The French couple who run it are charming and helpful. We needed some help with our hire car, and nothing was too much trouble.  The rooms were great, large, comfortable and clean, The food was great. The public areas are also beautiful and well kept.  As well as the two owners, they have a local guy who helps out and waits tables. He is also charming and speaks good English as well as French and the local tongues. It sounds stereotypically english, but although my French is not too bad, it is helpful to have a translator on hand.  The pool is great. really clean and a good size.  As well as the main guest rooms, they have a small room where they can put up a driver or guide if you have one.  All in all, heartily…",5.0
"Two nights in february, it's cold in the oasis at this time of year but the people at the hotel made this a warm experience. Great service, great food (as I was the only one there they served me a great set menu every night). Breakfast was great and I took a tour of the palfrey with the english speaking lad which was a great way to see the oasis and the village. An overall great stay even though the nights where really cold during february :)",5.0
"we were there for one night, in a trip in south morocco in 12/2012 .. we really appreciated and recommend it this guesthouse lays in the oasis of Skoura. It is kept by a couple of French : Yannick and his wife Colette which came to Morocco and opened their guesthouse in mid-2011. In France, they were duck foie gras producers, and for their retirement they wanted some adventure ..   Positive points - The Guesthouse is a 4 floor stately Kasbah, built in traditional style with dried mud mixed with straw. - the cheerful welcoming of guesthouse owners and the boy who is helping them in the reception hall. Everybody was so nice and gentle with us. They really received us as friends, and we appreciated. - The meals cooked there are very good, Moroccan typical meals with a frenchy touch…",5.0
Colette and Yanick have left their native Brittany to set up a very nice 9 room Kasbah on the edge of the facinating Palmerie in the Moroccan oasis town of Skoura. THe food is great as Colette is a passionate cook.,4.0
"Well, here is another great review for this place. It's so worth it!  The place is newly renovated and very cozy.  Dinner with 5 dishes (yes, 5) is included in the price. Everything is served very nicelly like in a French restaurant.  Owners (an older French couple) are your servants. Nice people, but speak no English. However, their helper speaks very good English.  Service - 5 stars.  Big rooms. Very clean.  Quiet location. Very cozy restaurant.  I only have one very small negative comment - the pilow was too high for me:) Actually it's a long ""roll"" along a double bed, never seen those before, so we just slept without it.",5.0
Skoura was admittedly a stopover for us on our return from Merzouga to Marrakesh.  But our stay at Kasbah ait ben Damiette ended up a highlight of our trip purely from the loving hospitality of Collette and Yannick.  Collette is an outstanding chef.. I'm still not convinced she wasn't a professional chef in France before moving to Morocco.  Truly outstanding food.  Wish we had more time to spend here to fully enjoy the Kasbah.  Recommend staying two nights at least if you can.,5.0
"Ait Ben Damiette is definitely the best place to stay in Skoura. We stayed 3 days and wished to we have stayed longer. Well situated by the Oasis in a very quite place, this magnificent Kasbah (Typical House of South Morocco) has been beautifully reconstructed. The rooms are immaculate, cosy and large. The place is an enchantment! Yannick and Colette gave us one of the warmest welcome. They took care of us like family during all of our stay and surprised us with the nicest attentions.  They have a great knowledge of the best places to visit around and provided us very useful advises. The surroundings are fantastic and Ait Ben Damiette is a nice place to use as a base to visit around. Regarding the food made by Colette, I have no words. Not only it is excellent but it is also…",5.0
"A fabulous family run kasbah just outside of Skoura!  The hotel itself is a completely renovated kasbah with charming large rooms, a gorgeous swimming pool and fabulous food!  But what makes this hotel so special are the owners -- Collette and Yinnick (and their small staff!) -- who are warm, welcoming, and just make you feel like part of their family!!!! I would definitely stay there again!",5.0
"Colette and Yannick, a retired French couple, run a really nice hotel-restaurant in the Skoura area.  Really attentive and excellent service.  Although not in a Paris ""Hotel Luxe-"" category, the rooms are very pleasant and generally well looked-after.  An rooftop terrace offers really good views of the surrounding oasis, village, and the High Atlas Mountains in the distance.    Although the location is a bit isolated (away from the town center), this would be an excellent location to serve as a base (for several days/nights) to explore the area (by car/taxi) with possible daytrips to Ait Benhaddou, Ouarzazate, and the Vallee des Roses and Dades Gorge.   This would also be a place for rest and relaxation, or a place to stay if one wants to escape or needs a break from the larger…",5.0

"I was recently in Skoura, Morocco with a photo group I was leading for Strabo Photo Tour Collection. We stayed at the Kasbah for two nights (wish it had been more). Colette, Yannik and Abdul could not have done more for our small group (10 pp total, including our Moroccan guide and driver.) They have made the Kasbah a home away from home and spared no expense. Rooms are comfortable and beautiful, with many French and Moroccan touches. The food was outstanding. They even gave us a place to set up our digital projector to review photo made during the trip. If you have a chance to stay with them, do it!!!!",5.0
"The French couple who own this kasbah are the whole wonderful experience.  The kasbah is quite isolated being a few kilometres from Skoura, which really is only just a tiny town with little to see in it.  They have renovated it in a very sympathetic Moroccan way, with iron four-posters with orange curtains on them etc and the rooms are large with plenty of room for suitcases.  They are the warmest, most hospitable couple imaginable, and serve each meal with such care and dedication it's heartwarming.  They take the lids off the tagines all at once with a 'voila' flourish and wait for your delighted reaction.  Each day you are greeted with a hug and both cheeks kiss.  The pool area is very pleasant, and the rooftop has stunning 360 degree views of the mountains all round, a…",4.0
"What an amazing Kasbah, superb rooms and such hospitable French owners. Stunning bedroom, with four poster bed, lovely pool area.   Live bread making demos in an outdoor stone wood burning oven. Awesome food served, perfectly presented. Really made to feel like we were at home.   We were also taken on a tour of the Palmeries with the lovely Abdul. Thank you so much for being so hospitable. You must stay here.",5.0
"Collette and Yannick were at the kasbah to welcome us as soon as we arrived (June 20). They were very gracious and helpful, showing us our rooms and the recently renovated kasbah. After relaxing for a while, we had our dinner by the pool. Dinner was delicious and beautifully presented. We never expected to have such a gourmet dinner in the middle of the desert. The refreshing watermelon and mint soup is unforgettable! The kasbah is definitely a peaceful oasis in the middle of the desert. Thanks much for your hospitality.",5.0
"We spent only one night at the Kasbah Ait Ben Damiette but we have been treated like king! The owners have the ability to make you feeling special providing a home feeling.  We arrived at the Hotel at around 6.30pm, and showed the different rooms available by the staff. Although by that time the owners were in the nearby town of Quarzazate for shopping, at 8.00pm we have been served a fantastic 5 courses meal entirely prepared by Mrs. Colette and served by the charming husband who had entertained us with the plenty activities him and his wife are involved to help the local community. The top of their kindness was at the time they had offered complimentary stay to our driver, totally unexpected but highly appreciated by us. We highly recommend this Hotel while on your way toward…",5.0

"Colette and Yannick are lovely hosts and were wonderful with our two children (4 and 6).  The Kasbah is outstanding, renovated just two years ago from scratch, using local artisans to create an outstanding property around 4 km from Skoura town.  We ate at the Kasbah each morning and night, enjoying exquisite Moroccan/French cuisine, varied, beautifully presented, and always with some ingredients from the garden.  Our hosts were also  fantastic to provide advice for local activities. We had a marvelous stay. No hesitation to recommend Kasbah ait ben Damiette, bon appétit!",5.0
"A wonderful welcome, a beautiful Kasbah and the most delicous food. We had read other reviews on trip advisor and decided to finish our stay in Morocco here .... we were not disappointed. Colette and Yannick are the most attentive hosts and nothing is too much trouble for them. The local people they work with are equally welcoming and we did a fantastic tour of the local palmerie with Abdou. At lunch time he took us to his family home where we enjoyed an enormous and very tasty meal cooked by his sisters and aunt. I think he only does these tours at the weekend but if you can book one then do. His English is very good and he able to impart much local knowledge. On our last night we heard a fanstic music, Colette and Yannick had even changed the day they had invited musicians to…",5.0

"Visiting the Kasbah ait ben Damiette was not a part of our planned tour round the southern Morocco, but a heavy rainfall that autumn turned the road the our booked hotel into a wild river, and looking for another place to spend the night in Skoura, we luckily ended there. The weather had given us a bad experience that day, but arriving here turned the memory of the day into a very pleasant one – we were warmly welcomed, and in no time we had got a charming accommodation and were sitting by the open fireplace regaining our warmth and the good spirit. The friendliness of the hosts and the delicious dinner that were served that night made our stay in Skoura unforgettable.",5.0
"On a recent trip to Morocco, I was tasked with planning our itinerary and all of the accommodations.  I'm a big fan of tripadvisor (props where props are due) so went online to begin my research.   This place got great reviews (albeit most in French) so I took note.  We had an aggressive week-long schedule in Morocco, anchored by a trip to the Sahara.  In order to get there from Marrakesh, we needed to drive through the Atlas Mountains - home to Skoura and this kasbah.  This kasbah was highly rated but most of the reviews were in French.  We were not deterred by the potential language barrier as the photos looked great and the reviews were steller.  I booked the rooms via email and used Google Translation to communicate with the kasbah owner Colette.  There are many different…",5.0

The only pity has been to spend there one night only.",5.0
"There are no words to describe this amazing riad, or better say magical castle! It is incredibly decorated, both in the common spaces and the rooms. The food is authentic and you can not imagine how delicious it is, both breakfast and dinner!  But above all is the warm hospitality that will truly make you feel like you are with family.   I highly recommend staying here. There are the cinema studios near by that will make for a great attraction.   I know I will be back!!!",5.0
"I stayed here for two nights as part of a group travelling through Morocco. The staff were all friendly and helpful, and one young woman serving us our meals was particularly helpful - I’m sorry I didn’t get her name.  Our meals were served in the courtyard, a pleasant oasis in the heat. The food was delicious and well prepared.  The pool was a nice place to cool off after a long day outside the hotel.  My room had everything I needed, although it was dark due to having only two small windows.  But every room in the hotel is different and some rooms had great views over the town and surrounding area.  The one negative about the hotel would be the number of stairs to get around the place, all with steps of different heights and of differing materials. The lighting was poor in some places and it would be easy to miss your footing. So I would not recommend this hotel for people with balance issues or problems with stairs.…",4.0

Beautiful, super clean, comfortabel beds, and the decoration throughout the house are unique!  We only stayed for one night as a stop before heading to Tinghir and Merzouga but I would not have mind staying longer. Breakfast and dinner were excellent.  There’s a pool to cool down in garden.  We got good tips from the owner on things to visite in the area.  Staff were all 1 by one 1 super polite, friendly and helpful.  Don’t hesitate, it’s really worth the stay!

"This is an exquisite place to spend a few days detoxing from the weariness of life. It is clearly a labor of love handcrafted over decades by its French ex-pat owner, Jean-Pierre and his Moroccan family. Every room, every detail is thoughtfully designed to convey the ambiance of an oasis in the desert. I encourage you reserve a room with a balcony, otherwise the inside rooms can feel rather claustrophobic. The pool is also quite small, but suffices as a way to cool off from the dusty heat. Breakfast was excellent and full of delicious variety. The only down-side is that the B&B's secluded location makes it costly to taxi back and forth to the town of Ouarzazate or the airport. When I checked out, I had a nice conversation with the owner regarding their struggle to keep the business running under the devastating impact of Covid on tourism in Morocco. Yet, in his uncompromising love for his venture, Jean-Paul continued to persevere and will hopefully see things rebound sooner than later. I strongly encourage you to patronize this establishment if your journey brings you through Ouarzazate.…",5.0

Tailored daily trips accompanied by experienced guides with a wealth of regional knowledge is a pure delight - I highly recommend the Valley of Roses , ask for Ali! Treat yourself to a traditional Hammam scrub followed by a relaxing massage and you will have the best night sleep!

Service was fantastic in all area - check in, luggage,ability to choose the room ,  room was amazing and spacious. Regarding food - dinner was ok plus, only downside was the chicken that was served for main course to us (other guests got couscous,guess i needed to request, although i thing you should not make differences between guest. I am in Morroco- i want local food not chicken! ) . Breakfast was nice but here again they offer regular omlette and not for example berber omlette which is local!  Anyway i still give them 5 stars as they are going out of their minds just to serve you efficiently and kindly.  Good work!",5.0

Exploring each room was fascinating and a delight which lingers in the memory (just see the photos).  There were a number of terraces from where there were fine views of the High Atlas and the surrounding desert.  The bedrooms were comfortable.  We had an enjoyable Tajine in the evening and a good breakfast.  Dar Daif is well worthy of its 5 stars.  The staff were very welcoming.  ",5.0

All three rooms were charming and all had a different decoraion and cachet. On leaving we congratulated the owner, Jean-Pierre, with the friendliness of his staff.

We were able to stay all together in one room (3 adults, 2 kids) and I hated to leave. Parting was sweet sorrow - literally made sweet with a goodbye gift and wonderful surprise car wash. Don't hesitate to stay with Jean Pierre and his staff, they are all five stars. ",5.0
We visited today and had the most fantastic lunch - thank you so much to Jean-Pierre and all of his welcoming staff! Some of the best food we have had on our stay in Morocco and a little oasis of calm and cool from the desert - we hope to return one day.,5.0
On the way to Merzouga from Marrakech we stopped in Ouarzazate and stayed in Dar Daif. It was magical place with lush gardens and terraces. Staff was beyond wonderful and always happy to help. Rooms were dreamy and so pleasant to stay with so many wonderful details to mention. We had triple room with terrace that even had a tea nook. On the way back from Merzouga we made sure we returned back and especially on insistence of our son who found it to be like a tale story. We warmly and highly recommend this beautiful place.

"Amazing and wonderful place!! We are a family with two kids (10 and 6 yo) and we loved it since the first moment we walked through the door: it was like leaving a hot and sunny world to discover a real oasis... the maison is fantastic, with original moroccan furnishing.... our room had a terrace with view: the staff immediately proposed to have our dinner there... dinner was excellent, staff very kind, all perfect!! The swimming pool was a gift after a hot trip from Marrakech...! We met the owner, a charming man who gave us precious suggestions for our way to the desert: he was extremely kind and fiendly.... thankyou to all...!",5.0
This is my fourth time staying in Dar Daif and I KEEP coming back because it is a real jewel. The house is a restored kasbah and full of treasures. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with both air conditioning and heating which is great for the hot summers and cold winters. The food is all locally sourced and freshly prepared and delicious. I highly recommend the lamb and quince tagine. The most important thing for me is the deep knowledge of the area of the hosts Jean-Pierre and Zineb. They are the absolute experts on this region and if you possible can you should book a trek with them. It will be a great experience - I had a marvellous time. ,5.0

"We were brought here by a Moroccan friend who had heard about the place though we were staying elsewhere. The fixed course menu was a real feast of locally sourced and carefully prepared starters--delicious marinated olives, pumpkin unlike any you have ever eaten, aubergine lightly seasoned, peppers in oil, courgettes in herbs, with savoury briouats: then a pastilla of the lightest pastry with perfect texture to the lightly spiced chicken filling. The orange tart for desert too was perfect. You will need to book in advance. It's not the easiest place to find unless you get a local to bring you, but well worth the visit.

Dar Daifa was the starting point for a trip hiking in the desert, organized by the owners of Dar Daifa (Jean-Pierre and Zeeneb).  When you walk into this Riad, you are entranced by the Moroccan decor that makes you feel that you have stepped into a story from 1001 Nights.

Of course you need to talk to the owner who will give you fantastic help and guidance for your trip. Listen closely as he is 100% accurate and might give you a hand drawn map. He is a wealth of information. Take a moment to chat with him. Loved this place. Highly recommend. ",5.0

Dar Daif is a really nice hotel ca. 10 mins drive from Ouarzazate center. It looks like na old castle, but offers fairly modern and clean rooms. One may say that it is another kazbah-like hotels in Morocco, but this one is really special as it's staff and the owner make sure that you will feel there like at home.

The staff was helpful and gave us directions to find the place. The room was ok.  We were served tea and biscuits on arrival which was a nice gesture.

The Kasbah is very much in keeping with the Berber tradition of the area, but with all the mod cons - wifi, air con, power shower.

Unfortunately, we were disappointed by the food served for dinner, especially after reading the positive reviews on trip advisor. The main course was reheated, we could taste it on the potatoes from the vegetable tajine. And the meat kefta lacked taste when compared to all the other tajine we have tasted over the past two weeks in Morocco. It was very surprising, and we thought the 22 euro per person was expensive. Maybe it was not the right season or not the right cook that night. The breakfast the next day and the lunch…",4.0
"Not only did we stay here 4 nights with wonderful service, great food - they organized a  3 day trip for us up the Draa Valley with a chauffeur and a guide. Lots of walking and some visits along the way. One of us continues on to the dessert for a week organized by them. Very highly recommended.",5.0
The personnel is eager to make your stay as pleasant as ever. The Kasbah is beautifully set in the middle of nature - the view from the terrace in the morning is spectacular. The Kasbah in itself is wonderful. We had dinner and breakfast (excellent and abundant). It's the top choice for a couple of extra-relaxing days. Our room had all the comforts. A plus to all this is the environmentally friendly approach that the owners decided to adopt in managing the Kashbah. Highly recommended.,5.0
"This was by far the BEST place we have stayed during a 10 days trip around Marrakech. The whole building is a live museum, exquisitely decorated. Food is fantastic and can be served on the terrace with views on the whole valley. The stuff is very attentive and kind  and the owner, Jean-Pierre, a very patient and thoughtful man who gave fantastic information and maps on the area - the trip was extremely unique thanks to him. Completely recommended!",5.0
"Was there for one night. Very friendly and helpful staff. Great location and architecture. Big and comfortable rooms. They also serve very good food. I didn't go to the Hamam, but my friend did and he said it was small, but good, traditional.  Don't trust the GPS or you will end up in very narrow streets. There is a nice way to get there.  I can higly recommend this place.",5.0
"Two relaxing nights here to break our journey from Marrakech to the desert. Well out of town, with a rural outlook and distant views to the lake.

"i was there and i feel as iam inside my family,nice place to stay in with a family or a friend. meals are so good,prices are normal...that place is not far from the kasbah of Taourirt,an ancien building that was built in the 17th century,studios of the cinemas is not far from the hotel,you can also discover the culture of the original people of Morocco.",5.0
"We had the chance to spend a night in Dar Daif. We had same last minute plans and managed to arrive one day before the day of reservation. We were 3 friends : Me (Moroccan), Vietnamese, and a Russian. It was by far the most authentic stay in a Riad or Dar during our 10 days trip. We also had free access to Hamam and a perfectly Moroccan breakfast. Before our departure, the owner gave us a map with special places to visit in our road to Merzouga. Last but not least, they washed our car. It was a pleasant surprise after a muddy road from Marrakech. Thank you",5.0
"The standard of service here exceeds 5 star easily, from a never ending supply of complimentary tea, coffee, biscuits, nuts and bottled water to the attentive and friendly staff even cleaning our car each morning!  The building is a traditional Kasbah design with all the modern facilities you could want and a few old ones, make sure you use the hammam! The rooms are tastefully decorated, comfortable and have air-con and wifi.  This was more like staying in someone's home as a special guest than staying in a hotel.",5.0
"A fantastically peaceful stay, with great food, lovely staff. I want to stay forever. I cannot find a single fault. It is a perfect place to use as a base to explore the desert and nearby oases.

We would absolutely recommend to spend one or more nights here!",5.0

The owner and stuff are so nice and helpful. The owner gave us useful informations with maps about surrounding trips and what do. The food was beautiful. Already upon arrival they served us fresh mint tee with home baked cookies. Planning a dinner here's a must. Everything you get is prepared in their kitchen.

The road that leads to this gorgeous Riad reveals nothing of the beauty that will be revealed to you as soon as you are inside Dar Daif. The building is large and complicated. It is indeed like a maze with rooms and balconies at each corner. It was one of the most beautiful Riads we stayed in Morocco and we truly wished we had more time to explore the building. Staff is incredibly friendly and our host (who lives in the Riad) is a true gentleman. A lovely breakfast which is included in the room price is served at any location you want in the garden.,5.0

Upon arrival, they served tea and immediately began giving some advice and maps about the area and our next destination. Highly recommended if you need assistance in planning a road trip or excursions. I also appreciated the recommendations in town such as the inexpensive shop Rabat In the town; there is not much in the city center for tourists.

After the hustle and bustle of casablanca and marrakech dar daif in ouarzazate was a welcome relief. It isnt a five star hotel by any means but for ouarzazate it was as good as it gets. (My ratings are based on ouarzazate hotels )The owner has 35 employees so the staff to guest ratio was excellent. I would call it more a riad than dar but I felt like I was in a moroccan home. The service was great and the food was the best I have eaten in morocco for only 23 dollars per person for a 5 course meal. The cooks were women and any body knows moroccan women are the best cooks. (Breakfast is included in the price of the room) You could either choose to eat outside your room looking at the desert and palm trees or eat inside the dining room which was full of moroccan rugs.

We booked the mini room, but were upgraded to a bigger room, that we would definitely recommend. Breakfast was magical in this garden and includes a small chat with the owner.

The food is delicious and the breakfast with several kinds of bread, cheese, marmelade, eggs, coffee, tea, fresh orange juice can be used on a terrace with the great view.  The hotel offers several excursions. We walked the Flint gorge and oasis. It was a beautiful and interesting walk guided by Ali. We had lunch in a typical Morrocain house.  The hotel is near the town Ouarzazatet; the bus stops in front of the hotel and brings you in 15 minutes to Ouarzazate.  Although we stayed only two days in Dar Daif, the owner gave us the feeling we were friends for many years. When we left we got nice Morrocain presents.  For sure we will go back to hotel…",5.0
"The hotel itself is very special - a restored kasbah in a village outside Ouarzazate.  Solid wooden doors let you pass through the high red clay walls into a hidden paradise. The welcome tea is offered in the courtyard beside a fountain, and you look up into a maze of stairways, balconies, terraces, rooms and dining areas. The friendly helpful personnel make it special. We were amazed when a mail message enquiring whether we could find their shuttle in Ouarzazte resulted in a pickup right where our bus arrived. We enjoyed learning to make pastilla with Fana, one of the cooks, and Dar Daif had the best pastilla we ate in Morocco. We had to save half for a picnic lunch, as the multi-course meals here are delicious but very filling.  A walk around the village gives you another look…",5.0

The property is really great, with access to rooms from the outside, with a lot of little (and larger) terraces... very very pretty and characteristic. Everything is very well taken care of, and I valued a lot the Dar's dedication to ecosustainability (recycling, use of local produce and fair trade, use of solar panels etc.).  Our room was lovely, though of a particular shape: we had an entrance area with access to the bathroom, and two beds/sleeping area. To access the main bedroom (very nice and large), we had to go through a little balcony (also very nice with a small table and chairs).

It’s not a hotel, it’s not a house, it’s a home and the staff make all their best to make you feel that way.

The rooms are all different: our first one was up lots of stairs so if this is a problem make sure you say so when booking as all sorts of rooms are available.

Our driver dropped us there after a long drive from the Sahara, and despite having a reservation, I think we had to sit for about an hour for them to get their act together. Pretty much nobody spoke English with the exception of one person (marginally) who I only saw once at check in. Then, while we were cooling our heels, we were told we had to make a decision on dinner immediately, so I translated the menu from French (lucky I did since there was camel meat hidden in it) and we gave our order.

After driving all day from Merzouga, it's just what I needed.  Great dinner out on the terrace, while listening to a local musician, who only stopped to hear the far off call to prayer.

There is a musician who plays at dinner. At the end of our stay, we were also given a goodbye present of date jam from the region.",4.0
"Staying in Dar Daif is a really pleasant experience! You feel very welcome the moment you enter the place. We were upgraded to a suite on the third floor: a very spacious room and waking up in the morning you see the sunrise from your bed above a beautiful landscap. The food is delicious and the garden is very pleasant to relax with a lot of shade and a swimmingpool to cool down. The place is situated a little bit out of town but there you will find everything you need to make your stay a very pleasant one: friendly staff, great food and pleasant rooms. The owner is very hospitable. He advised us how to drive to Marrakech via a very scenic route. And we liked it very much.

"This is the eighth of eleven riad reviews in Morocco, following the Marrakech review, and preceding our stay in Taroudant. Stayed on 30th April, 2014.  The riad is not actually in the town of Ouarzazate, but is about twelve kilometres outside, and to reach it one needs to go through a long stretch of unpaved dirt road. If you do not have the use of a car, this is not the place for you. However, most travellers to Ouarzazate are either on the way to Marrakech, Merzouga or the Todra Gorge, so it is inevitable that they have a ride.  The mansion is run by Berbers. Once past the main lobby, you are asked to take off your muddy shoes. We didn’t mind. Its multiple levels of rooms, lounges, halls and corridors are cluttered with chairs and sofas, rugs, art and memorabilia that make the…",5.0
We stayed at Dar DAIF after reading  several positive comments about the place. What a surprise when we arrived and find that we had the worst room of the place covered with dust the floor.!

Your maps were precise! You guided us to find architectural treasures in off-the beaten track areas which did not require more effort! We experienced many more aspects of  this wonderful country because of your experienced in organizing journeys of discovery. Dar Daif' staff is engaging and helpful.

"A friend and I spent one night in Dar Daif in January, 2014, on our way from Merzouga to Marrakech. We both have some physical limitations, so had asked for a ground floor room, which they gave us. We arrived quite late at night and knowing that would be the case, had had our tour company order dinner. The dining area is on the second floor, so the staff set up a table in our room and served us a five-course meal in our room. Fabulous service, and we didn't have to ask for it! The same service was provided for breakfast. And we were only there one night. The room (actually a large one and a small one as one) was quite satisfactory, although a bit chilly. The service was what was so special.",4.0

"We spent three nights at Dar Daif; exploring the Draa Valley area. This boutique hotel is in a somewhat surprising location, outside of Ouarzazate, but once you enter the high wooden gates, it is a world of its own. Superbly restored, in an authentic style, this riad offers memorable dinners, profound peace, and a very knowledgeable staff. The well stocked library is a bonus; as well as the gardens and roomy terraces . Jean  Pierre, the owner, is extremely helpful and knows how to explore the real Morocco. Quite a treat!",5.0
"Dar Deif is a very nice boutique hotel around 10 km away from Ouarzazate down-town. Based on the map provided by the mail it's easy to find with your own car. The setting is beautiful - located almost at the end of the road the view in front of the hotel is the vast green patch of palm trees and fields, which spread around a small rice in the south of Ouarzazate basically covering the whole view from west to east. Behind, the city, which has become quite lovely in recent years with it own majestic setting in front of the high Atlas Mountains. Due to the altitude of roughly 1200 m, the air is fresh and crisp.  The staff of the hotel is very friendly and attentive. The rooms are very comfortable and nicely decorated in a typical Moroccan country house style, which fits very well…",5.0
"We spent only one night in Dar Daif but it was one of the most memorable, particularly the dinner. It's a compulsory 20 Euro/person meal but totally worth it. Somewhat different from the typical Moroccan dinners with a tasty twist (e.g., spiced carrot salad, date ice cream). It was a beautiful setting - definitely worth it, especially if you then plan to drive south towards M'Hamid.  Also, Jean Pierre, the owner, was lovely and super helpful with informing the rest of our trip.",5.0
"We booked into Dar Daif via booking.com for four nights. On arrival we were greeted with a refreshing round of mint tea and biscuits and a lovely induction from the proprietor Jean Pere.  The location - outside Ouarzarzate so you would need to have a car or be prepared to get transfers from the airport. We loved the peace and quiet of the surroundings. It's right on the edge of the palmeraie so you can get a great view from the many balconies an watch the world go by.  The breakfast - was the same every day and this would be my on,y point of feedback. Sme variation would have been nice.

The common area is full of little decorative details, which provide a unique ambiance. Dinner and breakfast is served in the garden or on one of the many intimate terraces - while other guests and the hosts are present, the secluded spaces offer a very private setting. The most exceptional feature of the Dar are its surprising corners, terraces and sitting spaces, which invite you to spend time exploring them and relaxing.

It's location may be a bit unusual, but once you pass that big gate you're in for a treat.  Friendly staff, great service with attention to detail, charming rooms, truly excellent dinner, very nice atmosphere ... we couldn't find a single negative point, should have stayed longer.  Because of the low season, we also received a free upgrade to a nicer room. (we hadn't even asked for it)",5.0
"Dar Daif is located at the outskirts of Ouarzazate. As so often in the region, the appearance from the outside reveals nothing about the beautiful place this is, so don't be afraid if you arrive late in the evening and are put back by the somewhat shabby appearance of the surroundings. The place, as I understand, used to be a Kasbah (the word has a number of similar meanings, in this case the fortified home of a local chief), and has been remodeled into a hotel. The look is very local, attempting to recreate the ambience of a caravan relay post (caravansérail), with lots of wood, carpets, a dimmed and quiet atmosphere. You will surely dive into another world for the duration of your stay, but if you prefer and expect the modern, cool design of the fashionable moroccan hotels…",5.0

The staff is always helpful and cheerful... We chose a beautiful room on the courtyard and we had our dinner and breakfast just in front of our room... It is so nice to hear birds singing when you are having your breakfast... I wish we could have stayed longer... I would sincerely recommend dar daif...",5.0

The food was good, I had both breakfast and dinner at the hotel--which is well away from the town so going anywhere was not easy--and made for a quiet location.  The gardens are beautiful.  There is no alcohol at the hotel, but you can bring your own.

The evening meal was good and we were played to by local musician who managed to get a tune out of the four stringed ""broomhandle and bowl"" not sure what they call it, but he was brilliantly enthusiastic.

Some of the rooms were quite large, with sufficient room for parents and two children.  Our room was off the dining room, which was a bit strange in the evening as we had to stand at the nearby table while inserting the key in the door!

The swimingpool is small but nice, the communal rooms are in traditional style and we liked the general feel of the place.  The room we picked was quite cheap (EUR45) so we did not expect a lot, however it wasn't just small, terrible shower and in need of 'freshen up' but it had no external windows!

Having spent 5 days travelling to the desert and back it was lovely to spend time in this beautiful oasis of calm. The rooms were clean and well appointed (we had a standard room for one night and a suite the other). The place has so many lovely places to sit and relax whether in the garden or on the roof terrace.  We enjoyed pre-dinner drinks on the roof top watching the sun set. The food was spectacular, dinner was served in an open air dining room with a brazier and roaring fire nearby, it is a set 4 course menu and every item we were served was so tasty, well prepared and wonderfully presented.  We spent our free day wandering the roads and lanes of the valley and Skoura, it was great to spend a bit of time being amongst some more natural Morocco rather than tourist Morocco.  We arrived back from our walk about 2.15pm and the staff set us up a table in the garden for lunch and served such a lovely fresh salad.  What sets this place apart is the service, it was all so personal and friendly and nothing was too much trouble.

When asked if it was possible to get a beer ( very hard to find in Morocco ) we were told "" of course "".  Ice cold beers were soon delivered .  As was wine with our meal and a superb gin and tonic . All served COLD  and with safe ice . Amazing . Every single little element of this property has been thought about . Not just thought about but perfected . Food was the best by far we have tasted in Morocco  and  is easily high end restaurant quality . Thierry  and his wife have done just the best job .

You are all the best staff any 5 Star London Restaurant would be proud to employ . The pool was beautifully clean As was everything about this place. Romantic lights were everywhere  but tastefully arranged .  Various little seating areas  were dotted around to suit every taste. Our room !!!  Well  I'm sure most ladies love the little touches , Cotton buds , various bathroom essentials  not often found at far more expensive establishments . Did I mention the food ???   Oh my goodness  4 courses of the most professionally  cooked and served  food we have had in Morocco or Spain this trip . We are both vegetarian which wasn't a problem at all . My wife loved the donkeys that are well looked after . Lucky the dog was so well trained she never got in the way and didn't upset anyone ,  Gentle music played when we ate dinner which was a delight . We needed to leave very early to miss the heat when on the bike  6.45 am . This was no problem for Thierry who got his staff in to make us and early breakfast  !!  This service goes above and beyond . Thankyou  We are now in Marrakech  and just wish we were back with you all in Skoura .  You have made memories for us that will last forever .

There are two very friendly, entertaining cats on the property that made us feel at home.  Staff could not have been more attentive and hard-working.  We will miss this lovely gem of a hotel.",5.0

Food was excellent, as was service, wonderful massage, lovely suite ( Atlas), interesting local tour walking an hour to and from the Kasbah Amidril through the palmerie garden plots.

"It’s hard to exaggerate quite how wonderful this place is. Set amidst the palmeraie of Skoura, Les Jardins is an oasis of calm, a garden full of fruit and olive trees, vine-covered walkways and shady places to relax. Skoura is extraordinary with its ancient settlements, still occupied, and 400-year old adobe kasbahs peppering the skyline.   The service and food at the hotel are exemplary. Dining outside amidst the olive streets, sunset cocktails on the roof looking towards the Atlas Mountains.   And Abdul the masseur gives the most fantastic massage in the hotel’s delightful rooftop treatment room.   A completely wonderful place in an extraordinarily exotic location. I’d love to go back.",5.0

"After a long journey to get here from the desert, it was great to be so warmly welcomed with a drink and tour of the gardens - so lush and green. The bedroom was very spacious with all the toiletries, towels, water etc that we needed. We chose to have dinner outside- attentive service and delicious food. We loved having breakfast on the roof terrace. A big plus is the swimming pool. Staff were always on hand to help if needed. We had a guide in the morning to walk us through to the village and back- 3 and half hours in the heat but we had a lovely tea break with pastries. Would definitely recommend.",5.0
"This hotel is, as someone else said, an oasis within an oasis. We stayed here with our two adult sons (age 19 and 22) as our first post-COVID trip and to celebrate one son's HS graduation and the other's college graduation. The rooms are lovely, and the outdoor gardens, pool area, and terraces are so beautiful that I never wanted to be in my room. Our original plan was to only stay one night but many of the reviews said they wished this had been more than a stopover on the way to the desert, so we stayed two, and we were so happy that we did! The food was delicious at every meal, and on our stopover day we did a long walk around the oasis with a guide arranged by the hotel. It was fascinating to learn about how this vast oasis functions and to see the beauty and fertility that…",5.0

This was ideal for us as we did agree that tagine all the time would be overkill! The staff were very helpful as was Marie and Thierry who showed us the animals they have on site. Cute donkeys!

"All the accolades mentioned in the reviews of Les Jardins de Skoura are all completely true! What a wonderful surprise and treat to have had such an incredible repast in the middle of our three-week Moroccan adventure. The French owners, Marie and Thierry, were so charming, welcoming and gracious. The grounds are beyond beautiful, with many variations of cacti and shrubs. There are hammocks, sun loungers, mattresses, couches, and tables and chairs to relax, read, nap, chat, or have a delicious lunch. The rooms are exotically decorated with local tiles, fabrics, pillows, side tables, lamps and rugs, but at the same time, promote a feeling of serenity and tranquility.

"Located in a desert oasis, I was amazed at how comfortable it was inside the walls of their hotel courtyard. Skoura is lush with trees and vegetables and fruits, but dusty and subject to winds.  However, the hotel and compound dint feel that way at all.  Wonderful places to lounge outside on the shade, swing in a hammock,  or relax in the pool or AC, it was a relaxing and wonderful stay.  Our room was comfortable but not overly large, however,  it was clean, the bed was great, it was decorated very Moroccan,  and it was quiet.  The staff were so accommodating and kind as well.

"We paused at Les Jardins de Skoura for two days midway through an event-filled two-week trip across Morocco and found it the perfect place to decompress and recharge our personal batteries. The retreat is quite literally an oasis within an oasis: off-the-beaten-track, behind one of Skoura's signature kasbahs and adjacent to a lush palm orchard still worked in the traditional way. Innkeepers Marie and Thierry are gracious, accommodating hosts who keep a spotless house, and staff are always close by on the grounds to respond to any requests.

This place is beyond words amazing. We stayed one night as part of a trip out to the desert and quite honestly I wanted to stop there and not continue on. The gardens are beautiful and the perfect place to relax. There are several terraces with comfortable furniture to relax on and the entire place is decorated beautifully. The dinner we had there was probably the best we ate in Morocco and the staff is wonderful. The lovely couple who owns the hotel are so thoughtful and kind. The place is spotlessly clean and the rooms are gorgeous. I could go on forever about this place! If you are in the area it is a must!,5.0
"My biggest disappointment of our 3 weeks in Morocco was not booking longer at Les Jardins de Skoura! I simply loved this establishment! The rooms are perfect, the food was good, the gardens are beautiful & peaceful, the staff are super efficient & friendly, the location, while being difficult to find, is stunning & Marie & Thierry are the perfect hosts. I cannot fault this place. It is truly a Garden of Eden bordering the desert. I would go back to Morocco just to spend longer at this charming hotel",5.0
"We spent only one night at Les Jardin in the Saguia suite with two teenagers.  It was one of the nicest places we stayed in three weeks in Morocco, and I wish we could have added another night.  Communications beforehand were excellent.  Directions were good, and that was important as it is a bit difficult to find.  Once you walk through the doors, the entire property unfolds as a gorgeous, tranquil garden.  The grounds, terraces, pool and especially the food were all just about as nice as one could hope for.  The Saguia suite has a large master room, with a smaller room off to the side with two twin beds.  The décor is very detail oriented and quite lovely.  We read by the pool, swam a bit after wonderful salads for lunch, then had one of the better dinners we had in Morocco…",5.0

I told my fiancé that I wanted to have a secret garden just like theirs in our future home.  The rooms were clean and bed was comfortable. It was more like a traditional hotel than a riad, which was a nice change. The staff was kind. The food was good. We only stayed one night, but we were both wishing we had known how great it was and would have wanted to spend another day of our vacation there. I would tell anyone venturing out of Marrakech to make sure they stop here. I felt more relaxed here than anywhere else in all of Morocco!",5.0

Many many outside seating areas too (roof top decks). Nice swimming pool to cool off in. We stopped at the Toudra Gorge (spectacular & a must see) on our drive to Skoura. Ai Ben Haddou is also a must see & an easy day trip from Skoura.  The only bad thing is this hotel is VERY hard to find but well worth it. Roads do not appear on Goggle Maps/Waze.

Lovely spacious rooms, gorgeous terraces to sit on and look at the palm trees and dinner under the trees by candlelight. Everything was thought of. Reason for 4 star is we found out the next day after checking out that they refused to provide sleeping quarters for our driver.",4.0

Despite the appeal of dong nothing, there is quite a lot to do around Skoura, starting with a tour of the Palmerie itself.

Liz of Authentic Morocco hit another home run in booking us here on our trip from the Sahara to Marrakesh! The only improvement would have been to have additional time to explore the Oasis and relax and enjoy the amenities of this lovely, enclave. I am not sure that the best GPS would help in finding it. We are very glad our driver knew where it was! It is quiet and secluded. We are very pleased we had the opportunity to stay here",5.0

There's a tranquil quality about this little masterpiece.

The place is a rough ride off the beaten path, but this is Morocco and a high percentage of the roads are rough.  Only about five minutes off the main road.

It is a bit off the beaten track, even for Skoura but worth the extra 10' drive. Rooms are beautiful and have all the amenities. AC works well. The pool is refreshing at the end of the long day.  One of the best aspects is the dining, both breakfast and dinner. The chef is excellent and prepares meals with Moroccan and French influences. The soups are creative. I had the best tajine of the trip here. The owner and staff go to great lengths to ensure everything is perfect. What a find!!",5.0
"We stayed in the family suite which we can recommend highly. There is enough space and an extra room for the kids. The food was great and was served a bit in advance for our boys (they liked it very much!) and we could enjoy the delicious dishes in peace afterwards (obce with great live music!). Caroline was always very helpful with tips for tours (we liked the trip to the dades river with swimming there a lot!!) The garden, swimming pool and the donkeys were great and just like a little paradise. ",5.0
This was a lovely getaway place far away from all the big cities in a palm grove. It has a vast garden and great few terraces for viewing the sunset or having breakfast. The dinner was very delightful with caring staff and the overall feel was very comfortable. We would like to come back here one day with our family for a slightly longer stay and feel completely whisked away in this beautiful oasis.,5.0
"I could not stop taking photos!!! Carolyn has done a wonderful job of creating a paradise oasis in the dessert. Food was awesome, staff attentive. Do yourself a favor and plan to spend a couple of days here, we made a big mistake only booking one night. And the place is small so reserve well in advance. ",5.0
"As the tall wooden gate opened, we peered into the garden...we knew we were home. What a delightful retreat basically in the middle of no where.  Our  comfortable Moroccan bedroom and sitting area with fireplace was a nice beginning to the end of our long day on the road.  We were served Moroccan sweet hot mint tea and cookies in the shade of the large grove  of olive trees in the garden. Even though it was March a quick cold plunge in the pool was refreshing and invigorating  to say the least. We spent the early mornings, late afternoons and evenings in this wonderful garden after touristing each day in the region. We stayed three nights. What a pleasant paradise.   The home cooked fresh food was delightful both for morning roof top breakfasts, or evenings by the fire in the…",5.0

"We enjoyed an amazing stay at Les Jardins in the beginning of April. The serenity of the oasis and the kindness of all the staff provided a perfect atmosphere for a truly holiday feeling. The big rooms, the different level terraces, the swimming pool, the amazing food, the incredible view, the weather... it's unbelievable really. And to top it off Caroline's hospitality makes you feel very much at home.  If you're in the neighbourhood, go here. You won't regret it. We stayed an additional day (luckily there was 1 room left) and that was a very good choice!",5.0
"Our stay at Jardins was absolutely perfect - Caroline and her staff were warm, welcoming, and endlessly generous. The rooms are gorgeous, cozy, and private, in a beautifully restored traditional mud structure. The food is outstanding - our favorite meal while in Morocco.

"What a piece of paradise, nestled in the desert valley between snowy mountain ranges!   Gardens filled with perennials and herbs are dotted with private seating areas and the pool looked lovely.  But our favorite moments were spent enjoying cocktails on the beautiful rooftop terrace and sitting by the fire in our fantastic rooms (each of which  seemed to jump from a decorating magazine, and our's literally was in a book featuring ethno-modern interiors.)  We loved nuzzling the friendly dogs and cats, being homesick for our own.  Caroline is a charming and thoughtful hostess, and provided important travel tips to facilitate our overall journey.  This jewel is a challenge to find - we didn't have any trouble per se, but we heeded all of Caroline's warnings to get there in daylight…",5.0
"If you need a place to stop during your travels in the countryside of Morocco, this is a perfect choice.  Caroline is a lovely host and has created a unique, warm and inviting environment.  The rooms are spotless and decorated with a deft hand with unique and special artifacts.  There are plenty of comfy nooks and crannies all over the property for a person to relax and stretch out.  It was too chilly for us to use the pool, but the gardens are set up to allow you to curl up and read a book or just soak in the sun. The meals (breakfast and dinner) were delicious and plentiful.   A very special place in an country where hospitality is paramount.",5.0
"Two couples of a certain age traveling together. A beautiful  surprise hidden away behind the Kasbah and lush green and date palms. Competent,  funny and friendly staff. Beware of the straight faced jokes from one of the staff. Wonderfully restored buildings. Very comfortable. Excellent food and service. The owner has done a monumental job with the reconstruction and continues to function  as a very friendly and exceptional host. Highly recommended.",5.0

This was a great stop for an evening to escape the major cities and see some of the dessert.  The hotel was wonderful and dinner the first night was delicious.  It is a wonderful stop off the beaten path to spend a relaxing time.  The hostess and staff were excellent and professional.  Highly recommended.,5.0
"After a long drive from Marrakech (felt like crossing the Sahara desert on a camel...), we arrived at the Jardins de Skoura after dark. We got a very warm welcome with tea, dates nuts and cookies by the open fire followed by an excellent dinner (compliments to the lady in the kitchen for the freshly prepared authentic food. Cozy and spacious rooms. Magic gardens with all sort of trees (palms, pomegrenade, dates...) Great base for exploring nearby sites in day trips. Skoura itself is nothing special.",5.0
"We were going to stop in Ourrzazate but Sara from Sara and Alis' desert place recommended to rather stop in Skoura, known for its humongous palm tree plantation (palmeraie) that stretches over 10s of kilometres and hosts over 35 000 people! We had a quiet night after a delicious meal there (highly recommended as there is not much around!)",5.0

The property from the rooms, terrasses with incredible views on the palmeraie, the garden are very well-maintained and decorated with great taste and in the local traditional style. Carole gave us good advise for walks in the palmeraie and even her dogs to accompany us. We also learned a lot about the region in conversations with her. ",5.0
"After a long drive from Marrakech, this was a literal oasis in the desert.  It's off the main road and would be difficult to locate, but we were driven there by our guide.  Caroline, the owner, is lovely and went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable.  The staff is top notch and very professional.  The dinner was wonderful and even included some local live music.  Only wish we could have stayed longer!",5.0
"We stayed at Les Jardins de Skoura for two nights and were delighted with all aspects of this boutique hotel.  The owner and manager Caroline was very friendly and all her staff were happy, professional and helpful.  The building has been thoughtfully renovated to a 5 star standard and our room was cosy, comfortable and spacious. The gardens were delightful and the property reminded me of Kasbah Tamadot which we also stayed at.   However the big difference at Les Jardins de Skoura is the exceptional value for money. This hotel is so inexpensive for what it provides I would have happily paid more for the experience.  The breakfast, dinners and lunch were also excellent and very tasty, particularly the vegetable pasta at lunch.   We took a walking tour through the Oasis which was…",5.0
"we stayed at this beautiful place in October 2016. It was a welcome respite during our trip through Morocco. Caroline the owner was one of the best hosts we have ever encountered.

All in all would go back again tomorrow.",5.0
"Les Jardins was a lovely and relaxing stop amidst our long ""car days"" driving from the desert to Imlil.  The rooms are impeccable, the food is delicious and the staff is very caring and warm.  We stayed for two nights and would have loved to be there longer.  We did an a.m.guided walk through the palms and then spent the rest of the time relaxing by the pool and reading on the terrace.  Don't make the mistake of rushing through and only staying one night.  Treat yourself to a few wonderful nights at Les Jardins!",5.0
"We had three wonderful days here after some madcap full on driving to and from the desert.    It was utter heaven!    Our rooms were lovely, the food is really excellent and the pool and gardens are delightful.  It was magical at night to climb onto one of roof terraces and lie on a day bed gazing up at the stars.    One day we dragged ourselves away to explore the Palmeraie with a guide and it was a brilliant experience.  My daughters started off leading the donkeys, and then soon decided they would ride them ( aged 14 and 17 originally thought they were too sophisticated!)  We visited a local potter and pottered about the old Kasbahs and villages.  If you go do try to do this - it's magical and humbling.    The staff are kind and helpful.

"Our party of 7 spent 2 nights in this beautiful hotel and it was one of our favorites of the trip.  The kids loved the pool, gardens, and pets, and the adults loved the rooms, decor, food, terraces, staff... the list goes on. Breakfast in the garden was very peaceful and the dinners (one inside and one outside) were delicious. Special props to the eggplant salad (best I've ever had) and the beautiful rustic green tableware.  I wish I would have picked some up along the way.  Thank you Caroline for making our stay so comfortable and relaxing.",5.0
"A lovely spot, exceptionally well-run.  Lovely gardens (we did not use the pool, but it looked inviting), good food, and marvelous views of the palmeraie from the roof-top terraces.  We spent time walking through the oasis with a guide (no horses or donkeys were available, after all), birdwatching and admiring centuries-old architecture and irrigation systems.  We also toured the Khasbah, and if you visit only one in Morocco, make it this one.  The hotel is filled with marvelous architectural touches, and it is obvious that Caroline has poured her heart into making this a very special place.  Good WIFI in the garden by the front desk, and the best shower and bath amenities in all of our month-long trek through Morocco. Two nights were perfect.",4.0
"The more you learn about this little gem of a hotel nestled deep within the palmeries behind Skoura, the more you feel at home.  Caroline, the french proprietress, came here 14 yrs ago when there was no water, no electricity, and has turned the place into a charming little guest house which is nearly always full.  Pace of life here is wonderfully slow and a welcome respite from the craziness of Marrakech. A great stop over en route to Merzouga and the gorges.  You will love it.",5.0
"This place is beautiful - the gardens seem to be never-ending, as do the roof terraces and the huge choice of seating throughout the property! The hotel is located off the main road, so be prepared for a short bumpy ride, but it is well signposted and worth the detour.  We gave the hotel prior notice of our dietary requirements (vegan) and after a quick discussion with the chef on arrival, we were provided with delicious food for lunch, dinner and breakfast.  All of the staff and the owner, Caroline, were very friendly and conversant in English which added to the enjoyment of our stay.   Highly recommended slice of paradise near Skoura and a highlight of our trip to Morocco!",5.0
"My only regret about Les Jardins de Skoura is that I wasn't able to spend more time there. I just returned from a whirlwind trip through Morocco and Portugal, and our short time in the country meant we could only spend one night here on our way from Marrakesh out to Erg Chebbi.   But it was a lovely night :) The property is beautiful - lush, green, impeccably kept, dotted with fruit trees and sitting areas and crowned with a nice sized pool. It was raining and chilly when we were there so we didn't get to use the sun/sun patio, but I can imagine it'd be a great way to spend a restful afternoon. In lieu of the pool, we sat in the common room, where the gracious, accommodating staff built a warm fire and brought us glasses of red wine and little dishes of olives and nuts. The…",5.0
"Stayed 2 nights at Les Jardins with my girlfriend in October 2016.  Wonderful stay. Caroline and the staff were very helpful.  Caroline took the time to repeatedly call my car rental company to help me change my reservation. We had dinner both nights at the property and the meals were fantastic.  Breakfasts were also delicious.  The property itself is beautiful --- the rooms are well decorated, comfortable and just overall fantastic.  The entire grounds are great - pool, hammocks, multiple rooftop terraces and other secluded nooks to rest and relax.    Great visit!  We will definitely come back if we are in Morocco again!",5.0
"The owner, a french lady, manages this lodge in a magnificent way. It is situated in a weird place, yet once we entered this property we know it's the right place to stay. The garden is beautiful, the staff is friendly and disciplined, the food is delicious. Stargazing here is also stunning, I guess I saw the galaxy the first time in my life. A little oasis indeed! The room is not luxurious, yet it's OK considering that we are in Skoura and not in big towns.",5.0
This riad beats all! A wounderful place in a exciting environment! Top service and lovely rooms! Caroline is a real champ in running that hotel!  Halfpension was great!

"We couldn't believe our luck! The photos of Les Jardins online are beautiful, but they don't do this little oasis justice. Les Jardins is a beautiful, tranquil, luxurious escape quite literally in the middle of nowhere.  20 minutes down a gravel/dirt track you arrive at a fairly non-descript building, but enter through the beautiful wooden front door and what awaits is a little piece of heaven (and two VERY friendly dogs!). Les Jardins is a small, beautiful, well-equipped, clean hotel, which surrounds beautiful gardens.  We arrived at about 5pm, and it was only a day or two after the end of Ramadan. Apparently the hotel had been closed for a month, but the staff were busy making sure the hotel was clean and the gardens were perfect ready for the arrival of their guests.  We…",5.0

"So pleased to have discovered this little gem in the heart of the Skoura oasis. We stayed for a couple of nights whilst taking a tour from Marrakech to the Sahara. Our very helpful travel agent recommended a few nights stop here to break up the journey and to take a well needed rest after all our travelling.  We received a wonderfully warm welcome, had a very comfortable room which was beautifully decorated and had the time to relax in the sunshine by the pool in total peace and tranquillity. Fantastic! The owner was delightful and nothing was too much trouble, the same for her lovely and friendly staff. I would certainly not hesitate to recommend Les Jardin de Skoura to others who are in need of a relaxing and comfortable stop over in this magical place.  ",5.0

A warm welcome, good facilities, comfortable rooms ... But there is a huge problem that not everyone realized: the owner, a French lady, acts as a colonizer that controls her staff during their working hours with surveillance cameras and has a racist and xenophobic opinion about the local people.  This property needs to be boycotted by the public.   When my boyfriend published his review, a few days ago, the owner sent him a very aggressive message to cast suspicion on his identity... Absolutely crazy! Something proper of an unbalanced person who doesn't know how to react to criticism (as can be seen in all…",1.0

Traditional Moroccan cuisine served in the garden by outstanding staff is an ideal precursor to a comfortable night in one of the suites...ours previously housed seven members of the family that occupied the property.",5.0

Everything is perfect: the house with the lovingly and beautifully decorated bedrooms, the gardens, complete with their own vegetable and herb garden, the lovely pool with lots of places to relax from sunbed to hammock to covered terraces, the roof terraces where you can sit (or lie down) and watch the sun set over the oases and at night watch the amazing starry sky (Spielberg couldn't do it better...). At night candles are lit all over the grounds to create an even more romantic setting (if that's possible).

There may or may not have been an grey water or sewer issue in our bathroom--identifiable only by very slight gas scent (everything was clean and worked fine) but I did not bother to complain.

The service we had was very fine and...I would recommend you seek the place out because the gardens landscaping and hardscaping is exquisite  and it comes alive as the sun begins to set.

The setting is wonderful- lovely gardens to lose yourself in - great rooms-,big pool- dinner outside by candle light.

The gardens offers many patios, pillow couches, rooftops, and indoor gathering places for lounging with privacy.  The attached photo taken at dusk was not in any way touched up!  The well-heated rooms are equipped with characteristic nooks, local limestone bathrooms and, in case you prefer it, candlelight.

"What a beautiful place to relax!!! We only stayed a night but wished we were there longer. The property is a gem in the middle of the oasis with lush garden, beautifully landscaped. There is a sense of tranquility that surrounds you everywhere from the garden to the room and terraces. The room are tastefully decorated with traditional berber rugs, sculpted wood objects and beautiful rugs that create the sense of complete immersion in the culture of the southern Morocco. The service was superb and Caroline, the owner, made sure that we have everything we need and that we enjoy our stay. The food was also very good. Definitely an amazing place to unwind in a beautiful setting and feel far away from one's busy life! Highly recommend it!",5.0
"Very nice and comfortable place. The rooms are decorated beautifully. The bathroom is modern and the beds are very comfortable. There is good heating in the room and the wifi worked all the time. The staff provides exceptional service and are very helpful. The food is good and tasty but a bit expensive (19 Euros for dinner) but there are no other places around to eat.  The hotel grounds are beautifully landscaped and has nice little places to sit and relax. It also has a nice terrace with mattresses and pillows to lie down and look at night sky. The place is very secluded and hard to find without help from someone in the town.  It is located right in the Skoura Palmyra.  Overall, a good place to take a break for a day or two on the way to Merzouga desert  from Marrakesh.",5.0
"We spent Christmas Night 2015 here on our way from Sahara to Marrakech, and Madame Caroline made sure that we had a lovely stay proving herself a gracious hostess. She has created a lovely property here (be sure to look at the photos of the property when she bought it more than ten years ago to see the complete transformation). It is a bit hard to get to as it required a four wheel drive transfer from the main road, but we were rewarded with a wonderful night. Our room was on the second floor and quite spacious.

From our gracious welcome, to the spectacular and well-appointed room with a roaring fireplace, to the huge outdoor deck and the amazing canopy of stars, this is a place we will remember forever. When I left my scarf there, Caroline had it shipped to me. What gracious hospitality! I only wish we could have stayed longer in this magical place.",5.0
"We were so thrilled when we walked through the doors of this beautiful hotel! It is off the beaten path, and just like a Riad, the exterior does not hint at the beauty within. Owner Caroline has done a magnificent job decorating in an authentic Moroccan, sophisticated yet casual style. All of the rooms have their unique layout and feel. Our kids had a lovely room with a fireplace which they lit at night. Caroline treated the guests to a Christmas Eve party with a musician, and so thoughtfully presented all of the guest with gifs on Christmas morning. What a nice personal touch! The meals here were outstanding. Perhaps the best food of our trip. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. Very attentive staff. Beautiful outdoor spaces.",5.0
"We stayed three nights in this small hotel. It is located in the palmeria of Shoura, and may not be so easy to find, but it is worth the effort. When the large door is opened you enter a small paradise. We were welcomed by the exceptionally friendly staff, in this small complex which is all built from traditional materials, mud, straw and wood, like the kasbahs which are so plentifull in this area.  Our room was very comfortable, though not very large. A good bed, comfortable sofa, nice bathroom with washbassin, toilet and shower.

We sat on the most comfortable couches upstairs to share a smoke, glass of wine and facetime with friends back home. The meals were divine and the staff was so so so fun.

The room and bed were very comfortable and tastefully decorated, with a pleasant bathroom. But it was outside that took our breath away. A beautiful garden and lovely pool, a delightful restaurant area in the heart of the garden, and amazing terraces full of comfortable sitting areas.

The best place to relax and enjoy nature at its best.  A peaceful place with terrific atmosphere.  The hotel has beautiful gardens and a wonderful variety of fruit trees.

Excellent service, excellent room. Very nice garden  with grapes that are any time at the disposal of the guests. Lovely swimming pool. Delicious multi course dinners. Excellent wine list.  Guided oasis tour - organized by a local guide working together with Ms. Caroline - in the early evening an absolute must.  The place is easy to find. Just follow the orange flashes after leaving the main road. Incidentally, Skoura is absolutely worth while visiting. It is not touristy at all !",5.0

The grounds are covered in beautiful gardens, with fruits trees, grapes & flowers, in addition to wonderful pottery & lanterns. The pool looked inviting, but we were only staying 1 night, so we didn’t have a chance to enjoy it. Dinner by candlelight was traditional with a twist, and breakfast was also included. Wifi was free but due to the thick walls, was only available in the main common areas.",5.0
"Only had one night here, but would have been happy to have more.  Rooms were lovely and comfortable and it was great to have the swimming pool to cool off in.    Eating the evening meal in the garden with classical music playing in the background was lovely, but maybe a bit smart and grown-up for our kids.  Also, breakfast in the garden was plagued by lots and lots of wasps which the staff did nothing to try to help with which was a shame.    Overall, a lovely place, but not the most relaxed on this trip - maybe aimed more at adults than families with kids.",4.0

We only stayed one night but it was by far one of the best we experienced on a 15 day trip through Portugal, Spain and Morocco.  We LOVED everything about this place.  The quiet peacefulness of the gardens and the quaint and charming rooms.  Madame Caroline the proprietor was very hospitable and made a point to spend a few moments with each and every guest.  It is obvious that she takes great pride in her home and we loved that she was so inviting with all her guests.  The meal we enjoyed that evening was the best we had on the entire trip.  This is an excellent choice and highly recommended.",5.0

"Caroline, the proprietor of Le Jardins de Skoura, has meticulously thought of every nook and corner of this little Eden tucked away in the Atlas Mountains. From the tranquil setting of the pool to the colored themed rooms, everything is carefully considered to seduce its guests. We were very happy to return, we knew this would be a high point on our trip.  Knowing of its many enchantments, we reserved a day to just relax at the pool. At times I felt Caroline a little anxious that we go out and do some exploring through the region, or maybe she was just bothered by our lounging about... which was all we wanted to do. But this was the mid point on our trip, and nothing was going to deter us from relaxing and just doing absolutely nothing. Le Jardins is the perfect setting to just…",4.0
Travelling Maroc with small children asks for good planning and comfortable places to stay. Although Les Jardins de Skoura is not a place especially for children they did everything to make our stay (also for Abel 4 and Egon 2) just wonderfull.

"We are regular Moroko travelers and this time we decided to rent a car and to travel to Merzouga via Skourra in late June. This time of the year its already damn hot, so be prepared. Initially we booked for one night and it became 4 nights... On our way to the south of Morocco - Merzouga - we booked this lovely place in the middle of the Palmery and what an unforgettable experience this was. The owner, Caroline, is a great host and she takes care of every single detail from the arrival till you leave. The staff is great, alert, service minded and especially genuine in their service to the guests. A nice, well maintained garden with a lovely pool is the best you can get if you look for a quiet, relaxing place outside of the busy city of Ouarzazate or Marakesh.  The rooms are…",5.0
"In May 2014 .at first , the owner welcomed us in a very pleasant manner, showing us around. We liked the well decorated rooms, the big garden with numerous fruit trees and flower beds,very well organized into various corners and patios for privacy. The premises are immaculate, the restaurant offers breakfast and dinner outside and weather made it delightful. The large pool gives a relaxing atmosphere . It was a very pleasant and peaceful break on our 23 day tour of Morocco, giving also opportunity for short excursions in the countryside and we were grateful for an excellent service.",5.0
"I must admit the grounds were gorgeous. It truly is an oasis in the desert with a wonderful garden dining area, and several patios and terraces to lounge in as the hours of relaxation pass. The rooms are lovely and spacious, I appreciated that our twin was actually two separate rooms for sleeping.  However, the owner was surprisingly inhospitable. Our group stayed in 6 riads over the course of our trip and this was the only place that did not offer mint tea on our arrival (standard custom). Pricing was also stingy: our dinner and breakfast were included in our stay, and this was also the only place that charged us for water, juice served at breakfast, and the mint tea we ordered after dinner (believing it to be a replacement for the missed ceremony on our arrival).",3.0
"Beautiful oasis in the Skoura Palm grove.  Wish we had more than one night.  The room, grounds, terraces, restaurant and pool were chic and inviting. Very hospitable proprietor who thought of everything. Great food and atmosphere with stunning sunset outlooking over the palms from rooftop terrace.",5.0
"Reservation and communication with the owner / manager Caroline Lecomte (in excellent French and / or English) is characterized by friendliness and helpfulness. After a dusty ride of four miles over stony paths, we found a real paradise behind the doors of Les Jardins de Skoura. A beautiful garden which is lovingly cared for including a beautiful swimming pool and everywhere seats where Caroline offers you a welcome drink to greet. Dining in the garden is a celebration because of the extremely friendly service (applies to all the people that are working there), the beautiful surroundings of the garden, and the quality of the dishes. Caroline is always there to help, contribute ideas or organise things. A wonderful and very well organised place that I can recommend to anyone.",5.0
"It was a long drive to get to Les Jardins but absolutely worth it. Staying at this simple, charming hotel was a great experience and the owner has everything down to a tee. The location is just amazing within the Palmerie at the edge of the desert - an incredible landscape! The hotel really feels like a oasis within an oasis - it's quiet, green and very relaxing. The simple style gets under your skin and we could have stayed longer than 3 nights had we had the time. The meals were delicious and always served with a smile from the wonderful staff at the hotel.  The owner suggested two wonderful excisions for us - a guided walk within the Palm groves to understand life there and see the beautiful Kasbahs. We also did an amazing trip through the valley of the Roses and up to the…",5.0
"Hidden away amongst the palm groves of Skoura in an otherwise very dry landscape is Caroline's garden oasis which in our case was an ideal break from the dust and driving in the middle of our round Morocco tour.  Pure relaxation in beautifully landscaped gardens with well tended pool area and al fresco dining with some of the best food we tasted in Morocco.  We only booked for one night but soon changed our plans and stayed on to enjoy the experience even longer.  Caroline, discreetly omnipresent was very attentive to our every need and contributed significantly to the enjoyment of our stay.   Don't look any further when researching where to stay in Skoura - you won't regret it.",5.0
"Just returned from 10 days in Morocco and stayed at this riad for one night after having spent a night in the Sahara desert and before we drove to Marrakesh.  This is a wonderful place to stay!

The proprietor is a wonderful French woman who greets you and helps you with whatever you need.  The staff is very attentive, as well.",5.0
"Beautiful place located in a very unusual place - oasis on the Kasbah Route in a historic town of Skoura. The owner, Caroline, was extremely patient and accommodating as we got lost on the way and arrived very late. An excellent dinner was waiting for us (actually among the best meals we had in Morocco). The rooms and hotel grounds are decorated with impeccable taste. Excellent place! Do pay attention to the instructions on how to get there (attached to your confirmation form) as otherwise it will be very tricky to find. Once you find it, you won't regret it!",5.0
"We recently stayed for one night in this gorgeous little place in the middle of nowhere (well in town kind of) and it was lovely!! Great swimming pool area, beautiful food and plenty of it and clean, well maintained rooms.  The gardens are gorgeous and the hammocks are so relaxing after a swim. Nice roof terrace to watch the sunset or have your breakfast and well managed by owner Caroline, who  runs a tight ship and only too happy to help out!!  Staff were attentive and spoke english but a beautiful boutique type hotel with lots of nice touches that made you feel very welcome.  The ride through the windy streets is worth it!!",5.0
"We had no idea what to expect as we bumped along the dusty roads in Skoura, after returning for the desert, but we could never have expected this exquisite hotel.  Hidden behind a non-descript wall (as many things are in Morocco) and nestled in the palm grove in sight of the Atlas Mountains, lies an oasis of garden, with every little detail defined to perfection.  From the moment of our arrival until our departure, we felt completely welcome and relaxed.  The proprietor, Caroline, is a lovely lady who lives on-site and has made the entire place a home.  The Four Seasons does not even compare...any of them.  Our only regret is that we had not planned to stay for two nights.  Note that this hotel would be perfect for a romantic get-away or family stay.  There are animals…",5.0
"We stayed for 3 nights on the way to and from the Sahara.  Secluded in palm groves this is a perfect place to stop and relax after the clamour of Morocco cities.  Nothing is too much trouble for the French lady who owns the quaint adobe house, (In the UK it would be a listed building) which has been renovated to a high standard. The rooms are quirky and odd shapes but very nicely furnished with discreet but very effective air conditioning.  There is a small but perfectly adequate pool, and there is a large choice of little seating areas and terraces overlooking the palm groves.  The menu is a single fixed option (with diet options) but the quality is first class. Unlike some places the wine and drinks very reasonably priced.",5.0
"During a five day trek through Morocco, we stayed at this lovely hotel in the middle of a Palm Grove in the middle of nowhere.

However I needn't have worried and we had the most delightful meal of our 3 week Morocco trip. The food was delicious, the dining room was cosy and the Berber musician was excellent. It had a wonderful atmosphere. Added to that, the room was good with a very comfortable bed and the extensive gardens were lovely to wander or rest in. My husband said the pool was perfect after a hot day, and breakfast on the terrace was very pleasant. Caroline, the owner, knows how to look after her guests. An added treat was seeing her new born donkey.",5.0
"We stayed at the lovely Jardins de Skoura for one night in April, and we regretted we had to leave. The location is off the beaten track, hidden in the middle of the palm grove on a quiet street. The terraces, the garden, the rooms and the dining room are all very comfortable and stylishly decorated. The owner and staff were very friendly, Abdullah showed us around the property and was lovely to talk to. The food was brilliant, the wine was good, there was a pool which we didn't get to use because we arrived quite late, but this is definitely the kind of place we would return to for a longer stay. We highly recommend it!",5.0
"Spent 2 wonderful nights here. Great setting, lovely rooms. Had a glorious breakfast on terrace and lovely evening meals. Rooms good, with loads of gardens and areas to chill out in. The owner organised a lovely guided tour of the Oasis. Also visited the local Kasbah which is worth the time to go round, it is a museum and very interesting to see.",5.0
"Caroline goes to extreme lengths to ensure that you make the most of this 'oasis'.  The Riad is exceptional with a beautiful roof terrace where we took breakfast. There is an excellent variety of places to sit and enjoy the lovely grounds. The staff are of a very high standard and do not intrude upon your privacy. The evening meals are excellent value for exceptional cuisine. Caroline ensures that every morning that she personally speaks with you to assist in planning your time to make the most of the local area. I could personally spend a week there doing nothing more than relaxing, reading and enjoying the peace and calm.",5.0
"We spent one night at this property during our Morrocco trip in October 2013.  The property is beautiful and offers a very tranquil atmosphere. The service by the staff was average, but the food was shockingly bad. We were served plain pasta for dinner and I mean plain - no seasoning, no sauce, no vegetables, nothing! Dessert was fruit crumble - mushy bananas with bread crumbs on top.  While these were all bad, the obvious racial/class discrimination that the owner exhibited (and witnessed by most reviewers here as well as by us) is one I will not support and I am going with the lowest rating for this business. I am positive there are other places that have better business ethics and professionalism that you can find in the area.",1.0

TIP: if you are travelling independently do print off the map from the Les Jardins web-site, then it is easy to find. We stayed for four days in this lovely haven, well off the beaten track & surrounded by exotic scenery. The owner, Caroline has managed to transform the rustic buildings into stylish and comfortable accommodation, retaining a true 'sense of place'.

Only improvement suggestion would be to offer more variety for vegetarians for the main course.",5.0

Rooms are large and beautifully decorated, the food was delicious (the best tajine!) and served outside on the rooftop patio or in the garden. The owner, Caroline, was always available.

The room was lovely, with a seating area, plenty of space, a very comfortable large double bed, spacious and clean bathroom with a wonderful shower.

The food was all delicious, beautifully cooked and presented and excellent value for money. We had a fantastic stay, we would love…",5.0
"Our two+ week trip included stays in some lovely places, and Les Jardins de Skoura was my favorite.   First, there's the serendipity of finding a beautiful, comfortable and welcoming place at the end of a long dirt road, pretty far from major tourist destinations.  Then there's the desert/oasis setting that somehow manages to be completely informal and very sophisticated at the same time.  This dualism is no doubt a tribute to Caroline, the friendly and sophisticated French owner.  Her staff was wonderful, accommodating and genuinely welcoming.  We loved our suite and all the little nooks and crannies scattered around the site, indoors and out, where we could enjoy the sun or, later, the stars.  After three nights of relaxation, I wanted more.  And definitely go for a long walk…",5.0

The hotel is set some 4km off the road -- no roads are marked on the map. Follow the orange-in-white triangles off the road, and keep going.  I can't understand why Les Jardins doesn't have the top spot in TripAdvisor -- it is beautiful with great views towards the mountains, and well-equipped yet very intimate. Each room had a private relaxation/garden area, and the terrace, gardens and common areas were very pretty.  The staff were very welcoming -- we arrived very late, too late for dinner, but they lit a fire in a secluded room for us and provided tea and biscuits after a short tour -- a much needed and comfortable break…",5.0
This was the most beautiful riad we have ever stayed in.  It is in a spectacular location nestled in a palm grove and has lovely terraces with amazing views and also fantastic staff and food.

We will most definately be returning - and for longer next time to explore the beautiful surrounding countryside.,5.0

The gardens were a tranquil oasis. Highly recommended.",5.0
"The hotel is on the outskirts of Skoura and feels somewhat isolated.  Rooms were a bit small, but very nice.  The grounds were also very nice. There was a lot of rooftop seating, which would have provided great views of the surrounding mountains, but we were surrounded by clouds the one night we stayed.",4.0
"What a spectacular location.  A beautifully renovated house nestled into the palm grove, and surrounded by gorgeous gardens.  Dining was classic Moroccan but with the uplift of French character.

"Can't recommend it highly enough. Rooms and garden are lovely, the staff is friendly and the food is excellent. A true oasis, and one of the very best places we stayed in Morocco. The owner lives on site and is very hands on. She personally checks on guests to make sure that all is well. It was much appreciated.",5.0
"This was my second stay here and happily this visit was just as good as the first. The hotel has a lovely little swimming pool set in delightful gardens where breakfast and lunch can be served. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff could not be more helpful. The owner Caroline is a charming Frenchwoman who has created a very pleasant retreat in a quiet but very attractive corner of Morocco. Dinner was served in a 'Bedouin salon' in the garden and was both very good value and delicious. Be warned that after turning off the main road, there is a point where you may wonder where on earth you are going as you drive along narrow little lanes in the middle of the old village in the Palmerie. But don't worry, the journey is well worth it.",5.0
"We adored this place in the palmeraie and oasis of Skoura. The mud built hotel feels palatial inside with lots of classy furniture, hangings and fittings. There are loads of rooftop cushioned seating areas  to enjoy the views of the palms and mountains and sunsets. The gardens are a delight well tended by the friendly gardener a riot of pomegranate and olive trees and trellised grapes. Eating al fresco here was so lovely and the quality of food is excellent by any standards - especially for somewhere so remote. The swimming pool is on the fresh side but good to cool off after an afternoon walk (it was still in the high 30c when we walked). We had 2 nights here and it was a great place to relax on our road trip although as others have commented it is a fair way down a dirt track…",5.0

There are hundred little details to discover - not only in the garden but also on the roof terraces and the ni nicely decorated rooms. I couldn`t help to stay up late for the stary nights and get up earlier for the sunrise. Both you can see best from one of the roof terraces.

Attention to detail and unrivaled Moroccan hospitality make Les Jardins de Skoura truly an oasis you’ll wish to call home.

There was only one other couple there for one of the days of our stay, so it felt like we had the whole of the gardens and pool to ourselves. The set menu was perhaps slightly too exotic for our unadventurous selves, although it was certainly prepared with great attention and care.

Without a doubt, our stay at Les Jardins de Skoura (LJS) was one of the highlights of our 11 day trip to Morocco.

Don't waste your time researching anywhere else because this is the best there is.   Please stay for as long as you can - you will regret it if you just use this place for a one night stopover whilst on a tour of Morocco. Take time to enjoy it and taking the afternoon palmgrove walk is a must! The property is fantastic, the staff are very attentive and the food is the best we had in Morocco!

"This small riad owned and run by a delightful French woman is beautifully situated in the midst of a date palm oasis.  When we arrived we sat on the rooftop deck where we could see the lush green beneath us and the snow-topped Atlas Mountains in the distance. The grounds are lovely with many sitting areas, gardens and pool.  The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated.  We had an excellent dinner accompanied by very good Moroccan wines.  We all wished we would have had an extra day here.",5.0
"We stayed for 2 nights in one of the suites, and I can honestly say it's most of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stayed in. The gardens are so peaceful and pretty, the staff couldn't be more helpful, were very gracious and the food prepared by the local chef was exquisite. My girlfriend was unwell when we arrived, and the owner was very kind in offering some medicine and advice as to how to recover. Thank you so much. If you're travelling between Marrakesh and Erg Chebbi (as we were) I recommend spending a couple of nights to relax in peaceful and beautiful surroundings. We also took a tour around the palmeries with a local guide that was very interesting. The pool is also devine. See if you can find the pet tortoise who hides in the walled gardens!",5.0

Our two day stay at Les jardins de Skoura was delightful. A welcome break for us on a business trip in Southern Morocco. Highly recommended for those intrepid travellers visiting the area. Slight let down with the food...perhaps after more than ten visits to Morocco we have been too often spoiled at our regular spots. Pretty good value overall. Certainly would return.,4.0

At this time of year dinner is served in the small dining room (in the garden in warmer weather).

"A lovely place in the palmeraie (not easy to find on your own- I'd guess). Madame Caroline has mot only gathered around her a lovely team, with charm and humour, but she also provides attentive personal service to her guests. The place has a number of areas for sitting and relaxing in the garden and on the terrasses. When the evening is too cold, the dining room and its wood fires provides a very comfortable setting in which to enjoy a lovely dinner with greatnvegetable dishes (not to memtion the original tagines and soups).",5.0

The free wifi doesn't reach to the rooms, providing a reason to enjoy the garden and terraces.  Another is breakfasting on the roof terrace overlooking the oasis and the High Atlas.  The included dinners were tasty, the breakfasts good standard Moroccan, and Carolyn was helpful with laundry priced reasonably by the load, not the sock.

We loved having our breakfast ourdoors by the tented area with the view to the pool, and the food was excellent. The only regret was that we stayed one night, we could have stayed a week!

We had driven down from Marrakesh, stopping en route at Telouet (where we stopped for an excellent lunch at the nearby restaurant, sitting in a berber tent overlooking the valley and being served a delicious 3 course meal with drinks for 100Dh) and at Ait Ben Haddou, so it had been a long drive and we were looking forward to a rest.  We were welcomed with the usual refreshing mint tea and a tour of the gardens and roof terraces, where every interesting view offers a seat or a cushion for you to relax.

"We stayed at this hotel in early March for two nights. The room was very comfortable and the hotel is atmospheric, being decorated in local style. The manager - Caroline - and her staff were welcoming and helpful, particularly as during our stay the rains came and the river flooded, effectively cutting off the hotel for a day or so. Our stay was somewhat marred by the weather, but our one guided tour of the Palmerie was enjoyable and informative. Our waiter told us that now the long awaited rains had come he could at last plant his beans. We could not deny the relief that the locals had in the arrival of the rain, against which our limitation in walking round the Palmerie seemed small beer.

"This place feels like a luxurious French country inn and we highly recommend it. Wonderful breakfasts and dinners and very beautiful rooms and beautiful sitting areas, gardens and pool. We spent Christmas here and were very glad we did. It was one of the nicest places we stayed in a month in Morocco.

You will not be disappointed.",5.0
"We stayed at Les Jardins de Skoura for one night on New Years Eve. The hotel was gorgeous! The garden was wonderful with multiple sitting areas where you could experience a beautiful sunrise and sunset. The bedrooms were very comfortable and cozy. The bathrooms consisted of exotic brass fixtures. Fortunately, we got to spend New Years Eve here and the owner, Caroline arranged for a fireplace party at one of the areas in the garden followed by a multiple course dinner at the cozy dining room surrounded by live music and a fireplace. The next morning we were served breakfast on the terrace. Overall the place was very aesthetically designed with Berber and European architecture. This is one experience I will never forget!

Gorgeously appointed rooms, with local art, crafts, fabrics and furniture, and a large fireplace in every common room. The high walls enclose a delightful garden with all sorts of local flora and various ceramic and pottery accents. We enjoyed breakfast outside under a Berber style tent (it was raining).

A quick tour of the hotel was followed with some G&Ts and lovely French inspired snacks - buttery biscuits and salted nuts. Yum.

We were given a choice of rooms, all of which were full of character, well kitted out and spotless.  The public areas were well kept and inviting.

The owner, Caroline LeComte, was involved in every detail of the running of the place, but never lost her French chic. Ask her to book a two-hour walking tour of the palmerie with one of the local guides, and acquaint yourself with this fascinating ecosystem. The 6th century kasbah on the outskirts of the palmerie was one of the most interesting stops on our route.",5.0

If you dream of staying in an oasis, lazing on cushions on roof terraces, eating breakfast overlooking distant snow capped Atlas mountains, relishing in luxurious Moroccan decor, watching and listening to the traditional lute being played by fire light and enjoying wonderful food, this really is the place to be. Too cold to swim in the pool in February but lovely to laze beside and read. We enjoyed a guided walk through the Palmerie, across huge dried up river beds with crumbling kasbah around every corner.

The palm grove offers opportunties to explore the agriculture and irrigation systems and we were taken on a fascinating tour by a local guide.

The Skoura Pameraie is incredibly beautiful and the Jardins is a great place from which to expore it , whether on foot with one of the guides or as a base to expore the wider region.  I went on and stayed at Kasbah Tamadot in the Atlas at 5 times the price and could not get over how different the 2 hotels were. Jardins is the real Morroccan travel experience, very comfortable but without unnecessary frills, private yet neighbourly, down to earth but professional. Luckily the 5 hours drive from Marrakech does act as a barrier for the majority of people (!!!!) ...but what a drive.  Fabrizio was running the place in the absence of the owner and was an impeccable charming host.   thank you.",5.0
"It is all true what has been said in previous reviews, a beautiful garden and wonderfully decorated rooms (the only thing that is missing is a fridge!) in this palm oasis in the middle of Morocco! The food and service were wonderful, thanks again to the owner Caroline and her staff. However, it must be said that the prices for alcoholoic beverages are rather high, 25 Dirhams for a small small beer (you will drink plenty when it is hot) and bottles of wine start at 140 Dirhams (for example, we saw the same bottle of wine for less than 40 Dirhams in the supermarket).",4.0

"We can't say enough good things about our stay at this amazing Inn.  Incredible.  The place is truly a secret garden, with a gorgeous pool, incredible food, lovely accommodations, and lots of cozy, romantic areas of hanging out.  We were traveling to Merzouga from Marrakech with our 6 and 8 year old daughters and this was a perfect stop off before we visited the Todra and Dades Gorges.  The girls LOVED the pool, the gardens and the rooftop terrace. I wish we could have stayed for two night (I would recommend it!!!).  We also wish we could have done the hours walk through the Valley of the Kasbahs.  Lovely, lovely place.",5.0
"This was a wonderful experience and Caroline has made Les Jardins into a really lovely place with a friendly atmosphere. It is amazing how she has renovated the old building and made an oasis of calm in the desert. The rooms and gardens are very pleasant and in keeping with the local traditions There are lots of little nooks to sit in or lie down and soak up the sun. The view from the terrace is wonderful. The food and service were excellent. All the food seems freshly cooked and is well-balanced. It is really apparent that customer satisfaction is a priority. There is nowhere to go in the evening, so it's best to wear yourself out during the day.It is very interesting to walk around the palm grove and admire the horticulture and irrigation methods.",5.0

Nothing is missing:  - Amazing sanctuary/Oasis in the middle of nowhere. Lots of Privacy and space for everyone, weather to laze on terraces, spend time by the pool, somewhere in the garden or under a tent - Great hostess with a genuine sense of hospitality.

Les Jardins is 4km off the main road across a river. If you don't have a 4x4 you may have to call the hotel for the patronne Caroline to come a rescue you: I had to do this twice, and she was charming about it.

"We stayed two nights at Les Jardins de Skoura.  It is a bumpy ride to the place (perfectly possible with a normal car) but our approach was not made easier by a guy on a motorcycle who suddenly appeared in the rear view mirror.  He aggressively ordered us to lower the window, which we obviously did not do, and came dangerously close to the car.  Finally he gave up and we could proceed to Les Jardins.  We had the place all to ourselves.  The elements that made our stay so memorable are the secluded location of the place, the (night)swimming, the beautiful room (although very hot without airco, but we knew this in advance), all those hidden corners in the house, the beautifully decorated terraces from which sunset could be enjoyed, the colour of the sky after sunset and the palm…",5.0
Les Jardins de Skoura is located about 5 kilometres off the main road amid the palm groves just outside the town of Skoura.

The fireplace in our room scored very high on the romantic/charming scale.  Definitely worth a couple of nights.,5.0
"My wife and I have just returned from a holiday in Morocco, with three nights spent at the delightful Les Jardins de Skoura.   A few minutes drive outside Skoura, the approach is via a dirt road, a little bumpy but perfectly driveable in a normal saloon car. The somewhat tortuous route is clearly marked by painted triangles on telegraph and other poles.  This tastefully restored traditional building is set in a most attractive garden with plenty of shady seating and hammocks under olive and pomegranate trees or loungers for the sun-worshippers who prefer to grill themselves by the pool.  In common with most other guests who had written glowing comments in the visitors book we found the accommodation to be good value. Caroline was quick to move us to a larger room when an error…",5.0
"This is a gorgeous retreat, the road in is indeed navigable by ordinary car, but very slowly as it is pretty bumpy, and 4-5 kms in total, but definitely no need for a 4X4. The set up is superb, although I would not like to be there in the heat of summer without air conditioning, our room was very stuffy and airless, although very comfortable. Overall a great relaxing retreat, the perfect spot to see the Dades and Todra Gorges. Be sure to calculate your travelling time to get there, especially if coming from Fes or Erfoud direction, it is a long drive.",5.0
"The drive through the hamlets of the oasis and across dry riverbeds (quite manageable in a Toyota Yaris saloon car by the way, to contradict a previous reviewer) gives the feel of being well off the tourist track and Les Jardins are in keeping with their peaceful surroundings, pretty but unpretentious. The atmosphere is friendly, meeting other guests in the gardens is a pleasant feature after the city riads, and the accommodation and catering are run professionally. The food is varied and very good.  Cheerful staff are available all day. We especially recommend the guided walking tour of the Palmeraie, especially in the evening light. Our thanks to Caroline who put so much into Les Jardins.",5.0
"Stunning garden hotel set amongst the Palmerie of Skoura. It is about 4 kilometres down a dusty track off the main road across two dry riverbeds.   The gardens are an oasis very much required after a drive through the Atlas from Marrakech. An excellent base for a first night stop - roughly 4.5 hours from Marrakech.  Food was excellent - the evening meal by far the best of any hotel in our tour to Merzouga and back. Much of the food seemed to be grown in the gardens.   Room was spacious with an excellent shower, the only small gripe was that the bed was rather small.   Overall an excellent and highly recommended experience. Would have liked to stay for a few days but had to get on the road to Merzouga. Will definitely return for a few days relaxation from Marrakech.",5.0
"First I must comment that you cannot reach this hotel in a regular car.  You must have a 4X4, as you leave the road and travel across county to get to the hotel.  Neither the hotel nor the booking service informed us of this and there was quite a scramble to figure out how to get us from the town of Skoura to the hotel proper.  Apparently, other hotels in the palmery will offer to send a vehicle to pick you up, but not this hotel.  Once you get there, however, it is quite a lovely place.  A lovely garden, lovely pool, many beautiful trees and flowers, lovely, spacious rooms.  Be aware that no shampoo is supplied in the rooms.

Caroline the owner is extremely welcoming and thinks of everything. The staff are all very friendly too. We ate there both nights as there's not really much choice in the local area, and the food was great, some of the best we had the whole trip.

We stayed in a beautiful suite and before we left looked at the other 2 which were also perfect - rustic Moroccan with a woman's decorative touch. My advice is to ask for the Atlas suite which is slightly bigger and has it's own terrace - it's the same price as the other suites.

It wasn't entirely straightforward to get there, because after you leave the main road you have to cross a river ... and there isn't a bridge.

The large bathroom had a glassed-in shower with wand and rain showers, single sink, robes, one pair of slippers, soap, shampoo and conditioner.  We asked for another pair of slippers and two more large towels.  Lighting was excellent, and wifi was good.  There were adequate outlets.  There were no instructions for using the safe which requires resetting its inside red button, closing the door, creating a code, pressing the A button, and turning the handle. To open, enter the code, press the B button and turn the handle.  (We always test a safe before using it!)  There was a plate of fresh fruit in the room when we entered.  The buffet breakfasts and dinner were served in a very large dining room and included the typical Moroccan “tourist” items, including tagines.

"I agree with the reviewer who said that this is ""a comfortable hotel with issues"" because it certainly is that. We had a lovely room with a comfortable bed and sitting area. The AC worked fine, the lighted closets were nice and the bathroom was really big. But, as the other reviewer said, it smelled like sewage. And, whoever designed the bathroom should have thought to put frosted glass on the commode enclosure because, otherwise, you're totally exposed to whoever else might want to use the spacious room. The public areas are attractive, with interesting, large pieces from well-known desert movie sets that were filmed on the town's movie lot. The pool area was huge, with lots of tables to eat or enjoy cocktails. Yes, they're expensive, but not any more so than other resort hotels. It was slightly annoying that the pool bar was the only bar open when we were there, I guess because of staffing issues. But my husband and I sat on stools at the bar and didn't have any trouble getting served. The really unfortunate thing about this hotel was the food. It was awful.

"Rooms - Recently refurbished and comfortable. The bathrooms have an unfortunate sewage smell as the drains do not have traps.  Food - Average and overpriced. No menus in the rooms but a wide selection of choices, when you manage to find one. Nothing was particularly good. The food is overpriced but the drinks are insanely expensive.   Service - Waiting and kitchen staff are very helpful and friendly, if somewhat unreliable. The reception staff clearly would prefer you not to be there. Consistently make you feel like an irritant.

Bed was comfortable while the T&B was clean and tidy which I can not say with the other Moroccan hotels I stayed in. Food during dinner and breakfast was excellent. Would stay here again. ,4.0
"This place is opulent.  The rooms are grouped all on the ground floor, with lovely landscaping all around.  There is also a large pool.  The breakfast and dinner buffets are sumptuous.  Stay at least one night, even if you are on a budget.",5.0
This is a very large property with beautiful grounds and public spaces (featuring props or replicas from the many films done in the area). Lodging is in many outbuildings spread throughout the ground on lower and upper levels. Second floor rooms require navigating a steep set of stairs so you may want a bell man to assist. Rooms are quite spacious and well equipped although getting a bit worn down.  Dining is in a large restaurant set up buffet style for all meals. The food was surprisingly good and the variety of choice welcome after any days of just tagine and cous-cous.,5.0
"Beautiful place, big pool. The rooms are large and clean, we had a suite with a sitting area, the room has a safe, refrigerator, and good wifi. The bed was large and comfortable as were the pillows. The AC worked well. The room was quiet. The room also had a private patio, but no chairs or table. The tub was narrow so we had to be careful when using the shower and it was a high step getting in and out.We had the buffet in the restaurant the food was good as was the breakfast in the morning - good variety. The hotel has two bars, the drinks are pricey, but the staff is very friendly and helpful. They do take credit cards but I believe there was a minimum.",4.0
"This hotel is enormous, we had a very long walk to get to our room which was upstairs though they didnt tell us that when we checked in so we said no to help with our luggage as we had wheels.    We arrived in the evening so did a quick change then went to the bar near the pool.  My friend and I ( two women) stood at the bar with 3 men standing behind the bar making a effort NOT to make eye contact, a 4th man chatting up a young lady at the end.  Eventually, after we asked for service they almost fought to not have to serve us.   Buffet dinner was very average in selection so baguette and cheese for us! Room was so hot we asked to sit outside and were reluctantly shown a table. Breakfast was fairly good selection but again we asked to sit outside and they said yes but we had to…",3.0
"Le Berbere Palace is one of the best hotels we’ve stayed in the region with the spacious lobby area and pool. You would feel like you are staying an exotic paradise with good restaurant. I love the relaxing environment and rooms are villa like, spacious and quiet. The pool is a must-visit during your stay! Last but not least, the hotel is strategically located in a very convenient location in the city and you will find shops like craft store, food store across the street. However, some facilities in the room e.g. bathroom facilities are aging and should be renovated.",4.0
"We were lucky to stay here for 2 nights.  It is a 5 star hotel with 232 rooms.  The air-conditioning was great, the pool gigantic, there was a fitness center/gym and spa. WIFi was free and worked really well. In the room there was a safe, fridge, coffee maker, fruit, hair-dryer, and great shower.  We were lucky to be upgraded to a giant room with a living room and expansive porch with table and chairs.  The decor of the hotel is beautiful, pool is gigantic, and the food is great.  Be sure to only eat the cooked food to save your stomach.  Great place to stay.",5.0
"A beautiful setting in Ouarzazate.  My junior suite has large bedroom, sitting room, bathroom & separate toilet. TV (unused) in both rooms.  There’s even a private patio. Complimentary WiFi is strong.   Good dinner in the Italian restaurant.  There’s also a Moroccan restaurant that I did not try.    The spa features typical Arab Hamman experience.  I had a Hamman bath with black soap, body scrub & argan oil massage. Then hair wash & blowout all for about US$45 including gratuity. ",4.0

Disappointing was the dinner.  Both the starter and main course were disappointing.  Both the salmon from the starter and the chicken from the main course were dry as if it had been around for some time.  The chicken was hard and tasteless.  Typical tourist food but not appropriate for a five-star hotel.   The annoying thing is: it simply does not interest them.",2.0

Nice people that warms you on checking in.

The room is very clean and a little bit old style Morocco furnished but it is good. Restaurant offer three style menus.

"Nice smart place, perhaps surprisingly upmarket given the modest size of the city. We dined at the Italian restaurant, which served delicious pizza and huge burgers amid faded movie props and posters.  Both there and by the large inviting pool the hotel staff were not overly friendly - aloof rather than merely professional - a pity, as it took the shine off an otherwise impressive offering. Don’t come here for a glimpse of interesting Moroccan culture, but if you are looking for a swanky oasis in a dusty town, it’s a good place to visit.",4.0

I have nothing bad to say about the property itself.  Even the pool and lounging area surrounding it is gorgeous.  However, the staff....  The staff here was VERY unfriendly.  I had a friend who I had met years ago lived locally to this hotel.  Because he was a local they actually had security REFUSE to let him come visit me in my room, we were told that we HAD to stay in either the lobby or the pool area.  How ridiculous!

There is a nice Swimming pool and a spa near the pool area. The whole place is beautifully designed with plants and statues. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. If you want a nice, relaxing massage, then this is the place for you. If you need  a therapeutic massage, then you are wasting your money. It didn’t do a thing for me! Cost? $30.

"This exotic and somewhat older Ouarzazate hotel has large grounds with movie props scattered both in and out. We had a nice and large room with a comfortable bed and plenty of space. The in room safe was old and did not seem to work. This, however was not a deal breaker. The staff were welcoming and friendly and we had a nice night’s sleep. We ate a good lunch at the hotel as we were told that other places might not agree with our US digestive systems. At dinner, our waiter was overwhelmed, inattentive and took a few times to get our order correct. The dinner was not as tasty as other Morocco hotels. Breakfast, however, was very good.

Service was rather good.",4.0

We were a bit of a way from reception which was fine as the gardens were pretty. The pool looked very appealing but an hammam meant we didn't have time to swim.  The food was easily the poorest on our 10 day tour of Morocco. Bland, uninspiring and simply not tasty. Service was poor both in the restaurant and overall (other tour groups seemed to be getting more attention and assistance). They could reduce the score to 3 stars. It feels like a hotel that's trading on past glories rather then continuing to improve.",4.0
Our room was spacious but a long way from the main reception block and the room number was poorly signposted . Free botled water and excellent room amenities.

When we checked out we were surprised to be charged $12 for using the  4 little coffee pods. I have never been charged for self serve coffee in my room before! Over all it was adequate but I would not expect the 4 stars that they claim.  Pool area is nice but again, service is definitely lacking.  Ps we were in an upstairs room.

Rooms are spacious- I had small sitting room, bedroom and terrace.  Beautiful grounds, pool and spa.  Bar offers beer, wine and a few cocktails.  Very close to lots of restaurants and shopping.

The pool is beautiful and some people were swimming in it although it was not that warm.  I had a back massage in the Spa which was simply wonderful.  Recommended!

It is a very hotel complex in the design of a Riad. Our room was spacious. You walk through garden areas to get to your room. Breakfasts are buffet and more than enough choices. The bar staff is very attentive and friendly though out the pool courtyard. Pool is impressive but water is not heated for the time of year. Our room was a ground level unit. We had patio door access to a private seating area which made no sense as it was very small and walled out 2.5 feet and about 10 feet highly. To small for you to even stand in. We had a problem with the hvac as the air and the heat ran at the same time but it was fixed in due course. It is close to the shopping area. ,4.0

While doing this a bus or two of Chinese tourists pulled in and I had to interrupt 500 people to find a room with what I had requested and had been promised.

Since we did a trip to different hotels in Morroco that we reserved through Booking, I got confused about the breakfast and didn't remember it was in this hotel. I have to say that when we arrived to the hotel at night, no body told us information about the breakfast or anything.  The next day, we left. And the following nights when we arrive to the other hotel we had booked in Essaouira, they told us about the breakfast info; I told them we had it included and they say no.

The staff is very helpful and the pool is heated even in the winter which also seemed to be a rare thing in Ouarzazate.  We enjoyed our stay here immensely. The only negative experience being the transport to the bus station that a porter ordered for us.

Has a great and huge sports-bar area, great lounge, an Italian restaurant that also offers a fair breakfast. Couldn't swim because the water was cold as ice; but tried the spa..... Magnificent experience and service received.  I wouldn't hesitate to visit it again {!!!!!!!👍👍",4.0
The hotel impressed at first sight with its centrepiece tiled display pool and colourful tiled surrounds. It also caught the eye with its monumental ancient sculpture in its passageways reminding one of museums but in a decorative way.  There is a large swimming pool although we did not use it.,4.0
"A really great team with a warm and enthusiastic welcome, to their marvellous and rather special hotel, set in extensive grounds, with mid-sized rooms, in nice comfortable chalets along beautifully maintained pathways.  The spectacular massive adobe-built main building houses extensive function rooms, restaurants, lounges and encloses a spacious courtyard with terraces and swimming pool.   The New Year's Eve party organised by the hotel featured mainly Berber musicians and dancers, also New Year little presents (with locally-produced cosmetics from roses cultivated along the Dades Valley!) were left for us in the room, which were very much appreciated!  The hotel restaurant featured some really unusual, but amazing dishes (like beef & quince slowly cooked tagines and not only!)…",5.0
"I stayed here for two nights after finishing the Marathon des Sables in Morocco.  The hotel is beautiful with a fab pool. The grounds are lovely. Two is us shared a room which was lovely; two large twin beds in a large room on the ground floor. A separate sitting area with large TV. A separate WC and a shower/bathroom with bidet. Seemed more like a mini suite. The room was lovely and clean. The only niggle in the room was no tea, coffee or bottled water in the room. Luckily we still had some bottled water from the coach back to the hotel but we'd have loved a coffee. The only other thing was trying to find the room. We spent ages trying to our room, the numbering is a bit haphazard so a bit more signposting would be really helpful.   We couldn't fault the staff or the food…",4.0

A large pool with a bar and lots of seating, pretty grounds with flowers and seating areas, suites with a living area, bedroom, patio, and divided bath. It was pleasant and totally adequate. But the tub had a treacherous curved bottom and poor water pressure, the patio was a barren concrete enclosed space, and wifi was operable only in the lobby, It just doesn't rate 5 stars.",4.0

The room is comfortable - beds good, fruit basket, separate sitting area.  So it is a mixture of highlights and lowlights.",3.0
"I stayed here after completing the Marathon Des Sables and after seeing other local hotels we landed on our feet! Reception has a large water feature and sofas. Pool area is nice with good seating just needs the odd clean but nothing major, pool is cool and deep! Bar prices are quite high so be aware. Room was a family room with 2 bathrooms and a lounge area.  Gardens are kept well and staff are pleasant. At dinner they are too quick to clear tables and even removed 4 glasses of wine and the bottle which they replaced after a small debate. Food is if a good standard just not labelled as to what it actually is so a little guess work required. All in all a good hotel and there is a nice spice shop around the corner which also does a Hamman and massage, very recommend! ",4.0

"They shoot a lot of movies in this area, e.g. Jewel of the Nile, Gladiator, etc.  The movie stars stay in this hotel.  Jackie Chan was here when I was, but I didn't see him.  The hotel is new and really beautiful--the nicest place I stayed in two weeks in Morocco.  The food buffet was outstanding, for breakfast and for dinner.  One glaring shortcoming--the coffee is brewed in a machine and was the worst coffee we had in all of Morocco.  They have a lot of movie set pieces all around the hotel.  Now, why did I mention jasmine?  The rooms are in little bungalows and when you walk to them, you walk past a lot of jasmine bushes and it smells terrific.",5.0
"The hotel grounds, gardens, and pool are exceptional.  Our room was quite large and beautifully appointed.  The breakfast and dinner buffets were excellent.  A fun tidbit:  There were props from old movies scattered around the hotel.  Ouarzazate is the center of the Moroccan film industry, which probably justifies having hotels like this available.  We had a second floor room, giving us some views and nice sun exposure; the stairs were rather steep and tight, but the staff handled our luggage.  Our impression was that first floor rooms might be claustrophobic.",5.0

"The hotel is a rather place with ample space for many guests.  There's a large pool and outdoor lounging area.  Also one large main restaurant serving buffet that never seemed fully occupied when we visited.  The hotel seems to be set up for far more guests than when we visited in April.  One large bar was not open as a result but looked promising.  Rooms were basic and decent, but not luxurious, so spending time in the rest of the hotel seemed more appealing.  Service was friendly and helpful.  The town seemed easy to walk around and looked reasonably safe... was a little disappointed we didn't venture out to try restaurants upon the advice of the hotel concierge that we should just dock to the hotel buffet restaurant.  Not that the food was bad just that it was your standard…",4.0
"Stayed at the Berbere this weekend after completing the MdS. The organisers had booked a number of hotels in Ouarzazate and this was by far the best of those I saw/visited. Both breakfast and dinner were on a buffet basis, and considering that the hotel was full, the standard of food provided was extremely good. Staff were very helpful and the place was very clean. We had a room with a double and single bed, and so had lots of space. The bathroom was a nice size but was probably the one aspect that was a bit tired (cracked floor tiles, old style shower in bath) but was still perfectly fine. One point I would make is to try and pay for extras in local currency as the exchange rates in the hotel can be a bit challenging.",5.0
"We were surprised to come to such a great hotel in such a remote town. The Hotel and its facilities are first rate / class.

"This hotel is large with large spaces throughout, including the rooms.  After staying in a desert tented camp, this was a nice change to recharge for the rest of our trip.  The front desk staff were polite but not overly enthusiastic.  The restaurant waiters were more than enthusiastic to take your plates away when you were finished.  The restaurant food was buffet style, a large room seating more than 100, and it was loud and crowded.  The food was bland but there was sufficient ""spicy"" condiments to help the food along.  As this hotel is utilized by lots of the tour companies, expect it to be loud, crowded, and noisy during the high season.",4.0

Getting in and out of tub to shower was an accident waiting to happen.

It seems to cater to bus loads of tourists who don't care about food/room quality. The service, other than the bellmen was non existent.  The problem is that there probably is not anything better in the area.  ",3.0

That was a big mistake, the barmen were terrible and the prices were as high as in Marrakesh. My horrible margarita had only lemon and a drop of tequila, he forgot the rest. The dinner was in a dark depressing salon with hundreds of tourists fighting for the cheap food served on a buffet. It would be ok if they charged at least one third of their exorbitant price. I felt sorry for those who paid all inclusive and would have to return next night.",2.0

The pool area was very nice and the service was good. The hotel seemed very busy.,5.0
Stayed at this hotel twice and would book it again if going back to Ouarzazate in the future. The poolarea is amazing and great for hanging out. Thats definitely the best thing about this hotel. The rooms are a bit old but keeps still keeps a good standard. And its clean and nice. The food is so so. Eat at the french bistro opposite of the hotel instead.,4.0
"It was only one night stay - sadly I missed enjoying the pool and relaxing courtyard experience.  But it was lovely at night. The hotel is decorated with statues and furnishings from film sets which adds an unusual and exotic feel.   Rooms were like an apartment, very comfortable and spacious.",4.0
We stayed here one night. We were in a villa with 2 bedrooms one bath. Property is very nice.   Surprisingly lunch at the hotel restaurant was very delicious and reasonably priced.  Good breakfast.  You really can't go wrong here.,5.0
"Peaceful, serene hotel with small groups of rooms set in individual buildings in a garden-like setting with orange trees and lush greenery.  Hotel is filled with items from Egyptian movie sets, filmed in the nearby studios.  Absolutely beautiful pool and terrace area with attentive service both there and in the restaurant.  Highly recommended !!",4.0
Although I arrived late and left early I got a glimpse of this beautiful hotel. To walk to the room I walked outdoors for about 4 minutes. Its almost like a mini village. Every room is like an apartment on its own. The beds are extremely comfortable and the theme in the lobby has a lot of artifacts from famous movies that were filmed in the region. The staff is beyond amazing. I would love to come back to enjoy more this Berber gem.,5.0
"I stayed at the Berbere Palace after the Marathon des Sables and it was a lovely place to rest up. Food was wonderful and the breakfast had everything you could wish for. Lounging by the pool with a bottle of Casablanca beer was just what you needed. The rooms were a little bit tired but better than I had anticipated. Clean and very comfortable and all the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. The area around the swimming pool is wonderful for chillaxing. I didn't get to see much of Ouazazate (blisters prevented much moving around) but what I saw was a lovely , clean , fresh city and would love to visit again.",4.0
"Reportedly the place is favored by stars when staying in town to make films here in the Hollywood of Morocco. It is a spreading campus with a nice pool area, very nice buffet restaurant with wide range of choices (and 2 additional restaurants). Even the smaller rooms here have everything Inc good a/c. Wifi can be spotty. Grounds are beautifully landscaped and there are weird statues scattered about with info on the movie and director they are associated with.",5.0
We had a two room suite - large and comfortable.  The town of Ouarzazate is a good stopping off point and seems to be clean and safe.  The property was modern and the grounds were beautiful and well cared for.  A full moon added to the beauty of the 'near dessert' setting.,5.0
"We only stayed one night on route to the desert. It was a good hotel, pretty basic, but comfortable.The service was good, food was okay, pool looked good, and overall it was a nice hotel. We stayed mainly because it was close to some of the sites we wanted to see, but the sites can be seen in one day, so no more than one night in this area is needed. Our tour guide recommended only one night and that was perfect.",4.0
"Le Berbere Palace is a great place to stay after your Sahara experience.  The rooms are terrific, very clean and comfy beds.  The dinner buffet is also great.  A great many choices.  The breakfast buffet is also very good. The fresh orange juice machine is something to see in action.  Ouarzazate is the location of many movies you have scene.  The hotel has props from some of these movies around the hotel. ",5.0
"We reached there after a long drive after spending a day in the tent in desert,so what we needed was a clean room ,hot shower and comfortable bed,and we got it all there.as lot of films have been shot in that area,they have made few sets and few statues  and artefacts used  in those films which makes it very interesting.buffet breakfast was very good,a very big spread but dinner was not very appetising.Italian restaurant served very big portions of food but not up to the mark.we had good service by the waiters.pool was very good,I would say the highlight of the hotel.lot of sitting areas.",4.0
"The Berbere Palace provide lovely facilities and large suite rooms. The pool is lovely and there are lots of places to sit outside, both in the sun and shade, from chairs to day beds to sunbeds, etc. Having spent 3 nights in Marrakech with outstanding service, we were disappointed not to find the same level here. The service was efficient and helpful when asked but not forthcoming. The restaurant is buffet style and the food was pretty poor, especially for a 5 star hotel. The wifi was very intermittent.",3.0
"I arrived here after spending a tough week running the Marathon des Sables.  Whilst the hotel itself seems very good for the area I took an almost instant dislike to it because of the way i was treated , and it seems many other guests that weekend had the same treatment.   The hot water is rarely available , the rooms have a sweet 1970s opulent grandparents feel, a few of our lights didnt work in the room and needed attention. The reception phone is never answered, the wifi is sporadic and unreliable throughout the hotel. The staff insist on you paying for all drinks and food etc by cash at the time giving you a 'petty criminal ' feel rather than a guest that can charge to the room. when you pay the frankly outrageous prices for beer and food the waiter assumes every time that…",3.0

"The lobby, swimming pool area, and rooms are gorgeous. We had a suite with a small living room, one bedroom with a huge bed and a second bedroom with twin beds. Unfortunately, after a long day of travel, we were not able to get anything more than a trickle of lukewarm water in the tub and the shower didn't work at all. Wifi was only available in certain places in the room and would go in and out. The restaurants were good though, with wine and beer available, and the breakfast was extensive.",4.0
"Traveled with a group around Morocco and stayed at this hotel for one night (April 7, 2016).  Room was very nice and spacious -- two bedrooms (one with two twins, one with king), living room (couch, TV), bathroom (shower, sink, bidet) and separate room with toilet.  Had breakfast and dinner at hotel, which was good, and drink at pool bar.  Servers were attentive.  Down side was the front desk (not helpful with settling bill) and the spa.  Why a nice hotel like this would offer this type of spa service is beyond me.  No desk for reservations, and phone goes unanswered.  Went down to make appointments and very brusque woman made appointment.  Others in our group got no service at all.  Would rate this hotel much higher if they could sort out the spa situation.",3.0
These very comfortable rooms are clean and spacious. They are organised in groups of two and noise travels between the rooms. The tiled floors were clean and the breakfast both extensive and generous. The fresh omelette and the fresh crepes were particularly good.,5.0

"Great place as such but it has too many faults to get a better rating I am sorry to say. Very lovely decore, everything about it is stunning, I personally liked the movie extras in there and thougth it was a nice touch to the place but at the end of the day, it was a bit of a eh, well, experience. Brought on mostly by the staff at the hotel, perhaps after all the personal attention at the riads, this hotel and it is a hotel, let me down. From the minute we checked in to the minute we checked out, the staff at the front desk was rather offish, I was more of a pain for just checking in and checking out, then a valued client. They were very impatient and very slow with all the people in the back of me, yes, just not even professional for a large hotel in this country. They charged…",3.0
"Here as part of a group tour of Morocco.  Husband slipped and fell in shower, effectively ruining much of the remainder of the trip.  Bath was updated, had a clear plastic surround on one side that was not clearly marked as movable, and when hand placed on it, swung out, so that he fell.  Had to be taken by special driver for medical attention.  Hotel aware of situation, but did not offer any assistance or comments.   Slip hazards need to be clearly identified and remedied!",1.0
"An absolutely luxurious hotel! The hotel itself is breathtaking, staff was courteous and our experience pleasant. We enjoyed our meals and we took advantage of the beautiful gounds and pool.

"When we rolled off the hot and dusty highway into Ouarzazate, we were not expecting a hotel that was this luxurious. It is so beautiful to look at.  The pool and cabanas were just were we needed,   The staff was so helpful, the so bartenders so gracious, the food so delicious, and the rooms so comfortable.  I would recommend the Hotel Le Berbere Palace to anybody. ",5.0
"This is a pleasant, large and impersonal hotel. The decor is a over-the-top featuring film studio props. The hotel is spread over well manicured grounds. Our room was on the first floor and dark since one had to keep the blinds closed for privacy. My one caveat is that you should not eat here (breakfast buffet excepted). We ate dinner here and it was dreadful!",3.0
"Good hotel, nothing much around and away from crowded area. They had all the three restaurant hotels opened and fortunately I could get to eat some vegetarian food. everything is nice. You can relax in the bar after a long day outing around ouarzazate.",5.0
"Stayed one night in Dec 2015. Reception staff was a bit indifferent, and didn't provide any explanation about our stay - I had to ask him if wi-if was available, what the code was, where and when breakfast will be served, etc. Rooms were spacious but a bit dark and air conditioning was not strong enough to heat the entire room. We ordered the harira and kefta tajine for dinner which were both absolutely delicious. Breakfast was average. All in all not bad but wouldn't put it alongside other 5 star hotels I've stayed at.",3.0
"This was our only night in Morocco in a ""regular"" hotel - the rest were riads and tents.  The hotel is luxurious and frankly reminded us of many of the hotels in Scottsdale, Arizona.  Our room required a good walk from the lobby but it was a two-room suite with all the luxury and amenities one would expect in a 5-star hotel.  The theme of the hotel is the movie industry and there are posters and memorabilia from the various movies filmed in the area.  Many/most of the actors and film crews stay at this hotel so it is definitely upscale.  We arrived late and left early so didn't really get to enjoy the hotel that much.. The included breakfast was phenomenal with extensive choices.  The fresh orange juice machine was the best.",5.0
"There's not a lot going on in Oarzarate itself, but it's a good home base from which to explore the huge oasis, movie studios, Ksar Ait Ben Haddou (a World Heritage site,) and a day trip to Zagora to see the sand dunes.  Our room was large and comfortable with a nice seating area and a separate bedroom.  Unfortunately, the seating area smelled like smoke much of the time as the guests next door puffed up a storm.  The hotel's dining room has a huge and varied buffet; an excellent staff and delicious fresh picked and squeezed orange juice for breakfast.  The various movie props and posters from films shot in the area add a fun note to this solid hotel.",4.0
This is actually a beautiful hotel in the middle of nowhere. I don't mean to say it is out in the country but there is limited shopping close by. Most of it is closed in the afternoon. There is one good store across the street to the right but that is about it. There are only a few restaurants close by but not many. the food was acceptable and the villa type unit I had was clean and modern with a good bed. WiFi worked in the room. English is so so with the staff. Where the really shone was I had a medical issue and the front staff called a taxi and told him what I needed. The cab went to great lengths to get me my pills (you can guess why!) and the bill was only about two Euros although I paid him in his currency. That was both ways to the drug store and waiting for me. When we…,5.0

Fresh juices, yogurt, cereals, cheese, bacon, sausages, baguettes, sweet pastries and an omelet station. After having traveled in a Muslim country for three weeks, it was nice to be able to make a ham sandwich for breakfast. They also have a bar if needed.  All in all, a good stay.",5.0

"Stayed here recently on a tour. One of four hotels that we stayed and definitely the worst. The property itself is lovely, beautiful pool, good size accommodation totally let down by the poor staffing and service. Our party had 12 rooms between us and every room had problems, safes did not work, missing robes, our mini bar was empty, we had a fruit bowl with no fruit, light bulbs broken. The staff on reception were rude and dismissive, the waiting staff inattentive and badly trained. It could be a great hotel but needs better management. In comparison our other hotels were superb.",3.0

"Ouarzazate is a city on the border of the Sahara Desert, with not much to do (except explore the nature by quads, buggies or visit the famous movie sets).  Berbere Palace is a gem in the middle of nowhere with amazing suites.  The luxury hotel is definitely worth it's overpriced stay.  The room has absolutely everything a five star hotel can offer, with two large TV screen, one for the bedroom, another gigantic one for the spacious living room.  The ambiance of the hotel is very cozy and welcoming.  It can get a little dark and intimidating at night for certain guests to roam around the hotel, but being such a large hotel with a big pool and very tasty restaurant give it it's high ranking.

"Located in the town of Ouarzazate, which is known as Morocco's Hollywood, this hotel provides lovely 'cottage rooms' for each guest. Our room had a king size bed, a sofa, chair, coffee table and desk. Internet was free and a bowl of fruit was provided on our coffee table when we arrived. Large tiled bathroom with bathrobes provided.  Beautiful swimming pool with lounge 'beds' and chairs...gorgeous setting.   An on-site casual restaurant serves lunch and dinner, but a more formal restaurant is also available for fine dining. Breakfast was included with our package and the chef prepared omelets to order. The wait staff was very accommodating.  Nearby is Kasbah Taourirt, an historic site, that included an interesting tour by a local guide (available on site).",5.0
"This is the best of Ouarzazate.  I stayed here 14 years ago.  The only thing that changed is it is no longer a Sheraton.  And I'm sure there is new paint since the building and grounds are spotless.  This is  the best hotel in town.  It is well worth the price difference to stay here.  I was upgraded since the occupancy rate is low (middle of the summer in the desert).  The suit is beautiful, 2 big flat screen TV's, good wifi, and the bed is very comfortable.  The restaurant is excellent.  You have a choice of Italian, Moroccan, and international menus.   I felt the price was very reasonable (steak for $15).

"This place is a real must if you love movies. While there, a Bollywood movie was being filmed and the place was full of actors and staff. On the night of the King’s 30th anniversary they hosted a dignitary part for the city. This is the best place to stay in the area. The price, however, is outrageous. We stay in a special two floor suite for over 5000 MAD for the night. Yes, it was nice, but those are European prices. They had all the VIP amenities you could want; pool, spa, restaurant, grounds, bar. The pool was large, but the Jacuzzi was small and dirty. The Spa had almost no services and was much smaller than the photos. Wonder if it was the same place. It is the best place in the city, but very expensive.",4.0

I notice some of the reviews of this hotel mention poor service.  That was not my experience as service for me was very acceptable.  I do have one criticism of my room at this hotel....inadequate lighting.  I found my room to be too dark and without ample lighting, especially after sunset.

This is a great hotel if you are fond of movies. Ourzazate is the Hollywood of North Africa and a lot of international films have been made in this town and the hotel is littered with some very interesting remnants of the sets used for the movies.

The living room lighting was also ridiculous; the room was good only for watching TV. We dined there for both dinner and breakfast, both very, very good buffets.

"Quarzazate is Morocco's location for filming movies.  Therefore, the theme in the reception area and lobby are movie props.  The property is expansive, with rooms outside the main building in apartment style.  There were two floors in our apartment, we had a lovely bedroom, living room, W/C, and bathroom.  TV's were in 2 of the rooms.  It would be a marvelous place to stay for a vacation, with several lovely outdoor sitting areas and another large beautiful pool area. It was quiet, staff was friendly.  We thought the buffet breakfast was excellent...couldn't think of anything you could possibly want they didn't have. Omelets, to cereal, to hot dishes, to fresh squeezed OJ. There is a great French restaurant not far from the hotel!",5.0
The basic facility and grounds are very nice but seem a little run down and could use some updates.  The pool area seemed real nice but we were there in February and could not really enjoy it. The buffet dinner and breakfast had a wide variety of good quality items but nothing seemed really outstanding. It is probably one of the best hotels in town but not in five star shape.,4.0
Movie set props litter the public areas of this luxury hotel. Our room was large and comfortable. The service was outstanding. The buffet breakfast was the best that we have had in Morocco. We would recommend it.,5.0
"This hotel is rated as a 5-star and it does a good job living up to those expectations.   Staff are very friendly and helpful from the moment you arrive until departure.  The rooms are large, well lit and comfortable.  Ample choices for meals if you choose to eat on site and both dinner and breakfast were a buffet, a real plus for those travelling with picky eaters (children).  The only downside, and it was a minor one, is that our room had an outdoor only access and a set  of very narrow stairs to enter with no landing at the top.  This presented some difficulty navigating bags for three people however a very minor inconvenience.  We highly recommend this hotel when visiting Ouarzazate.",4.0
"Decadent breakfasts served by warm, friendly staff. A delicious pool, outdoor and bar area to relax in. A gorgeous bedroom with the biggest most comfortable bed I have ever slept in whilst away from home. For a while, this beautiful hotel has been my home away from home. I hope to be back again. I have loved every minute of staying here. Gina Bartholomew. Room 324",5.0
"The whole place seems to have had an update...lobby, restaurant, pool areas, spa...except the rooms....they still feel a bit outdated, specially the tub and showers. Great to be greeted with some fresh fruit in the room. Lots of options to choose from at the spa. Had an interesting new years eve ""party"" that ended at 1am (i am mexican and used to great parties, but I do understand that muslims are not exacly party people) Great breakfast buffet. Pleasant stay overall",5.0
"This elegant hotel contained lots of movie set memorabilia inside and outside.  The pool area was very nice with lots of lounge chairs and shaded sitting areas.  Most of the rooms are in 2-story buildings scattered around the property.   The grounds are very large and although there were some directional signs for the rooms, several travelers in our group had to ask for help in finding their room.  We had a very large suite with king-size bed, separate living room and a large bathroom.  Breakfast was an immense buffet with made-to-order omelets, ham, bacon and lots of other selections (fruits, breads and a cappuccino machine).",5.0
"After I stayed at a variety of hotels that either didn't have hot water or heat, this hotel was like ""Ahhhhh"". I think I might've heard a choir when I walked in the room.

"Our suite here was spacious and well appointed, with huge bathrooms (which was very nice after spending a night in the sandy Sahara!). The staff was friendly and helpful, and the breakfast spread was amazing. The dinner is buffet style but actually quite good.   Also, we traveled in December and it was quite chilly. While the heat was lacking at many other places we stayed at, we were able to get nice and toasty in our rooms here.",5.0

"This hotel has hosted many film crews due to its proximity to film studios and desert locations -- so it is chock full of statuary from film sets.  It's fun to walk around its corridors and public rooms and see what's around the corner. It was too cold during our visit to take advantage of the nice pool area.   Dinner was in a large dining room, divided up into many sections with a giant array of cheeses, desserts, hot dishes, salads, etc.  Though I don't generally care for 'buffet dining"", this was actually very good.  Service for wine and keeping the table spotless was quick and solicitous. Breakfast choices were unbelievable huge and delicious. Oddly, the entertainment was a live string quartet struggling with some Western classical music.  We had wished they had broken out…",5.0
A very nice albeit large hotel that is well appointed. Of particular merit is the food and dining experience. The Oasis restaurant  offers a large and sumptuous spread (for dinner and breakfast) and the wait staff is extremely accommodating and very friendly,4.0
"I've stayed here four times when shooting in either the nearby studios or on location. After a dusty and hot day at work, the hotel is the perfect place to unwind. Yes, it's a little sad, and needs a spruce up, but it's a comfortable base where relaxation is the order of the day. (Try the massage!) The staff are all a bit gruff, apart from the Doormen, but if you accept that they are doing you a favour by being there, you'll be ok.  The Dining room is very overrated, and most people eat across the road in the lovely french restaurant, where the service and food are exceptional. (I always make a beeline for it) Some rooms are a route march away, and on this last occasion I had the absolute furthest away from Reception, which was tedious if I forgot something as I was about to…",4.0
"I stayed here for 1 night during a tour of Morocco with OAT.  The hotel, grounds and service are all wonderful.  The movie props were interesting and unique for a hotel.  The food and breakfast were superb.  My room was quite large with a sitting area and huge, modern bathroom.  Everything in the room was ""like new"". I wish I could have stayed longer.",5.0

"We stayed here for one night as a part of a tour. I suspect that it is a place to stay out of convenience. Firstly, we had a blackout that lasted for hours, not necessarily the hotels fault. We had a second blackout the next morning. The decor throughout the lobby is chintzy, from movie sets.  It looks worn. The rooms have a mildewy smell but are roomy. We had a very trying incident with the wait staff in the buffet dining room.  Our tour group was supposed to get water at hotels. As hard as we tried to explain this the point did not get across. The staff was downright hostile to us. I finally went to the front desk to resolve it. not my expectation!!",2.0
 one night as part of a OAT tour.  This hotel was a modern surprise. My room was a suite with a large bedroom and sitting room. Both had flatscreen TVs. Fresh fruit was waiting in the room. The bathroom was modern would be where the tub is really slippery. Great service at the bar and the breakfast was excellent.,4.0
"Staying here is a slightly unreal experience. It is quite possible to rub shoulders with movie stars here. I saw Ben Kingsley in the lobby. The huge grounds are full of impressive props from the nearby studios, bringing Roman and Egyptian artifacts here and there that collide with the Moroccan ambiance. The rooms themselves are located in a sprawling maze  where it is easy to get lost. If you can find your room, you will find it to be well appointed and comfortable, with a sitting area and a fruit basket. The restaurant, pool and bar are enormous and are wonderful places to socialize. You will have lots of stories to tell your friends about this place when you get home.",4.0
"Stayed at Le Berbere Palace one night as part of a luxury group tour.  To me, the hotel has seen better days and is living on past reputation.  It seems to be the only large hotel in Ouarzazate that I could see so is the only place a group could stay.  The décor is flamboyant with large Egyptian statues and dusty, left-over movie props.  The grounds and pool area were quite beautiful though and lively.  The rooms are set about the grounds in 2-story ""villas"".  Our junior suite was on the second story, up a very narrow and dark set of stairs.  The suite had an unusable, tiny parlor (couch so hard you couldn't sit on it), but large, comfortable bedroom and separate toilet and sink area.  Windows looked out to the next building about 10 feet away...so balcony was very unappealing. …",3.0
"This is an elegant hotel on a huge site, with lovely gardens and plenty of facilities: when we were there, for two nights, there were lots of film people, ranging from elegant (possibly) stars to scruffy film crew. Our stay didn't get off to a good start, as the first room we were allocated was covered in dust sheets as workmen were changing the furniture. However, one of the doormen saw the problem, went off and quickly organised another room for us.  As it was mid-afternoon when we arrived and we hadn't eaten, we went to Tablapizza, by the pool. It was open and staffed, but we were told by the waiter that they couldn't do pizza! At that point a senior manager came past, and pizza suddenly became available again. The pizza chef appeared, and grumpily prepared our food: however,…",4.0
"Stayed at the Berbere Palace in Ouarzazate for 1 night. Compound is set out kind of like a maze of villas. We were at the end of a really long path and then found out we were upstairs - the stairs were REALLY narrow and steep, a real struggle to get 2 x 25kg suitcases up and then down again when we were leaving. Room was really nice though. It had a common living room area with lounge, tv and fruit basket, then there was one twin room and one huge master room with a huge king sized bed, tv, desk and wardrobe.  The bathroom had a seperate toilet which is handy when everyone is busy getting ready.  The pool area is magnificent! Just looking at the scene screams luxury!! We met Kelsey Grammar while we were there too! Very nice guy. Dinner and breakfast at the buffet were both…",4.0
"What an incredible place!  We stayed here for one night during a coach tour and it was beautiful.  Vast grounds with heaps of lovely places to sit with a drink and just chat.  The pools is massive and there is a great bar and restaurant to socialize in.  We were there while they were filming the third season of Game of Thrones, so the place was bustling!  The rooms are lovely, clean, large and comfortable.  I wish we could have stayed longer.  There are also a lot of props from films that have shot in Ouarzazate.  The walk into town is about 15 minutes and I felt very safe on the streets at night.  It's a different sort of town from the rest of Morocco and you can very clearly see the money that has gone into it from the film industry.  I would LOVE to go back to this hotel.",5.0
"Le Berber Palace! What a magnificent place! I was extremely impressed at this hotel which is one of the very finest in Southern Morocco. I very highly recommend it.  My room had a king-size bed, a small closet, and a dressing table with large wall mirror. The bathroom had a large tub, sink and lots of amenities. There were lots of clean towels and a bathroom there. The commode was in a separate room.  The included breakfast was served buffet style, and it was a fabulous feast.   The entire hotel was large, modern, very clean, and had a friendly, helpful staff.",5.0
"The spacious (and I mean SPACIOUS!) and beautifully landscaped grounds, huge outdoor seating areas, and movie props and paraphernalia are reasons enough to visit Le Berbere Palace. So is the dinner buffet. But if you want a completely functioning and well-maintained room, I would stay somewhere else.  Many desert-themed films have been shot at Quarzazate, and the hotel houses many souvenirs from them, for example, posters, big statues, throne, chariot, and much more. Just across the road is a currently working movie studio, ECLA Studios. The big pool is sparkling and beautiful and surrounded by comfy cushioned chaises, umbrellas, even curtained canopied beds. There are many well-appointed indoor and outdoor areas to meet over a drink and pet one or more of the many roaming cats.…",3.0
huge rooms though sterile-no warmth or style. buffet for dinner was mediocre at best though again there was lots of it. spa was strange: masseuse left mid massage then came back. also took a phone call!  left the door open for most of the massage and there was only a small towel covering my backside. Ouarzazate is a film industry site and there were lots of actors around. also props from previous movies/tv shows.  the grounds of the hotel are lovely.,3.0
"This would not be a five star hotel in many other places.  To get to your rooms, you wonder around outside down the paths.  There is an initial sign directing us and then no more.  It was raining while we ran around searching for our room.  If you have to walk outside a ways to get to your room, they should supply umbrellas (and have better signage or provide maps).  Thank goodness the toilet was separate from the rest of the bathroom because the shower leak badly.  The pool looked very nice although we did not have time to use it.  The pieces from movie sets all over the lobby are fun and add a nice character.",4.0
"Convoluted pathways to our rooms made us feel as if we were in a hyper-modern medina. Typical of '5-star' third-world hotels the rooms were huge, the lighting barely existent and the shower funky.It sprayed outside the tub in 2 seconds. However, their breakfast was the best we had in a 2-week trip. The area is the center of film-making in Morocco and one of our group spotted Ben Kingsley in the lobby. It was also fun to see the studio with its 'Oscar' statues outside. We also saw some buildings where films were made, i.e. the room where the 'snake' scene was set from Young Indiana Jones.",4.0
"We stayed in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom ""superior"" room with separate living room.  The size of the room was great, however, besides looking cheap and lacking character, one shower didn't work, the air conditioner has a timer and it shuts off in the middle of the night, and 3 light bulbs were burned out, making a dark room even darker.   We tried calling the guest services but ""surprisingly"" the phone didn't work, after sharing our concerns TWICE the problems were fixed.  On the positive side, the pool area was pretty and the food at the hotel restaurants was good with very reasonable prices.",3.0

"And for the not-so-beautiful, though you will run into movie stars looking just like you. Modern, European/Americanize hotel with large lobby, large pool (albeit frigid; why not heat it?), a plethora of mini suites with separate lounging quarters and large bedroom and modern bath. Why oh why, in a place as attractive as this does the water flow out of the shower and onto the floor because the glass partition is not long enough? Towels fluffy. Spa treatments. Good and reasonably priced massage at spa. My only regret: Not having hours and hours to enjoy the luxurious breakfast buffet, by far the best we experienced in Morocco. It is as if it is the one place that the French use of butter in croissant lives.",5.0

The buffet food offering excellent. Great buzz around the place as film crews were staying there. Happy days!",4.0
"Very pretty hotel. The pool area was quite lovely although the water was cold. For some reason, we were given a complete bedroom downstairs with a full bath and a living room and then a complete upstairs suite as well. Comfortable and spacious. In the middle of town but you didn’t need to go out at all. There were props from movies scattered all over the hotel which were fun. I’d stay there again. Note: as with most of the hotels lately, when I took a shower, there was water all over the floor as the glass enclosure piece isn’t wide enough.  It was also easy to get lost in the complex as it was spread out quite a bit.  Also note that when there are movies being filmed in the area, some of the filming crews and actors stay here. I was happy.",4.0
"This, is like the last reviewer stated, is a palatial estate, with very nice gardens.  The rooms are huge and all systems worked well.  The a/c was efficient, and the rooms very clean and quiet. The beds were flawless The breakfast was also very good.  The only criticism was that the hotel is dated, but they are starting a remodel as we visited.  The pool was beautiful but surprisingly cold with air temperatures in the upper 80,s (low 30's C). We could not comment on value, as this was a hotel on a tour.",4.0

Absolutely nothing to complain about here, at least for me",5.0

The rooms had a sitting room, and was very nicely appointed.  The bed was very comfortable.  The pool bar was very nice and the pool was great.  The movie props to me seemed a little like a cheesy Las Vegas. The buffet was quite large but very crowded for breakfast.   They had a nice variety.",4.0

This hotel has a very distinctive pool with lots of nooks to sit and enjoy the scene. This hotel has great WiFi connections. Very contemporary but no flat panel. The rooms do have patios. Note if you get a second floor room you will be carrying your bags up a winding stair case. Also there are light switched to illuminate the stairway. I learned this after using the cell phone to get to the top of the steps.,3.0

"I had the pleasure of having to search out hotels in Ouarzazate at last minute due to an issue with reservation in another place (it rain and the camping we reserved was all wet and humid), by far, after walking in and out of a few others, this is the best hotel in the area. If you have the budget, do not doubt it, stay here.  We had two rooms for me and my family, they were outstanding quality, better than many so called 5* European Hotels. Very well maintained, exceptionally clean and comfortable.  The Pool area is very big, the water was perfect and they have very good service for drinks and snacks, part of my family was feeling a bit off, so we stayed most of the day in the hotel and we had a great time. Breakfast was excellent with a very good choosing of cold and hot, nice…",4.0

We arrived at the Berbere Palace and we were greeted with warm smiles (Moroccans are great!) and a very nice hotel. The rooms are very big and the bed was amazing! Plus, the air conditioning was very strong and very cold! I loved that.   The grounds reminded me of Scottsdale Arizona or Palm Springs. It was desert chic and very resort like. The pool was spectacular and the whole atmosphere was very relaxing. I wish we could have spent more time here. Berber people are wonderful!",5.0

The bar is pretty well stocked, and they'll even make you a martini.  The local beer is okay, but they have Heineken also.  There is a very good French restaurant across the street from the hotel.

"We had a clean, modern suite, which worked really out great for us, and seemed to be in much better shape than other rooms reviewed here. I found it very relaxing and the air conditioning worked well. I enjoyed the kitschy movie props used as decor in the main areas. (Given the nearby film studios, it was entertaining to see the film crews gathering for working meals.) We also enjoyed an afternoon by the beautiful pool. However, the one thing that wasn't to our liking, was the buffet meal plan. The quality was fine, but it's not our preference to line up and graze. It's a very large property, and overall, it worked for our two nights in this area as another smaller property was booked.",4.0
"The staff are mostly very friendly but the service is terrible and the rooms and facilities are all in rather poor condition.   Our AC broke four times and every time it was a hassle to get someone to come ""fix"" it. Eventually we moved to a different room.   It's a shame because the pool area and even the restaurants have the potential to be really nice. The space itself is great. Unfortunately the food and the service are both abysmal.    They call themselves a 5 star hotel but that's absurd. If they were rated by any legitimate hotel ratings organization they'd be lucky to get 3 stars.",1.0
"This hotel has an overall impressive look to it and they have taken advantage of the film industry based nearby, so lots of Egyptian statues and the like, good for photographs. The quality and finish of the workmanship in this hotel is not great, doors that don't close, unfinished tiling etc but as a colleague said to me, 'this is Africa!' We had an upstairs suite, the stairs are narrow and the coming down the clear head height is only about five foot where the upper level crosses the staircase so be careful. Be careful getting in and out if the bath for a shower, the nearest hospital is not just down the road! The pool is large, looks good but did not have time to use it so cannot comment further.

It was more like a studio apartment rather a standard room in city hotel.

Tea took an age to arrive and the milk a further 20 minutes. The suite was OK but lighting was poor in the lounge area. Dining was buffet style and on the first night, the hotel had to cope with an influx of delayed passengers from the local airport, so very busy and extremely noisy.

At breakfast coffee was available only from machines, so one had to go back to the machine each time for a re-fill. Checking out, there was only one staff member to deal with a small queue and it took 20 minutes.

Although the salad bar was large with many delicious looking options, the hot buffet table food looked dried out and over cooked.

"Overall -- a very nice hotel. Room was very comfortable and clean. We had a separate seating area. The walk to our room had lovely flowering trees and shrubs.  Buffet dinners were marred by too many Continental dishes (the Moroccan food was good, but the rest -- not so much).  The poolside dining was marred by the overwhelming smell of ""compost"" -- otherwise known as manure in the plantings.  But -- there were lovely and very friendly cats who were anxious to be friendly and see how much of the continental dishes they could cage from the tourists -- which was very very nice for those who missed their pets!",4.0

Huge bed, very firm (which i love), and a giant TV. I was also greeted with a bowl of fruit, walnuts wrapped in Dates and salted almonds - Delicious and a nice touch.   I was also lucky enough to have a look at the Kings Suite which is incredible if you have the budget, it even has its own dining room and 3 separate bedrooms.

"In general, I think it matters greatly whether you are traveling to or from the desert.  Obviously, if you have been roughing it, the hotel will seem more glamorous and comfortable.  If you are coming from urban, five-star accommodations it will seem less so.   Specifically here are three responses to earlier reviews and room tips -- working backwards to the beginning of 2013: May -- There is good shopping down the street as well; don't limit yourself to the stores you can see from the hotel entrance. March -- The rooms are not the same;  there are lovely suites available as well. January -- I thought the ""cheesy"" movie props were actually rather charming -- celebrating Quarzazate's film industry (Atlas Studios is one of the largest in the world.).",4.0

Food is terrible and you can easily avoid eating at the hotel as the main square is a short walk away where there are many better options to eat and try out. We unfortunately had dinner and breakfast included in our package and ate both meals which were very bad!!! We even returned most of dinner uneaten and the waiter asked us, ""Hope it isn't that you don't like the food and only that you are full""!! Breakfast was the standard fare as made for feeding bus loads of people. Few options when you are travelling and need a one night stop over.",3.0
Enjoyed a good meal here on a day trip between Marrakesh and Ouarzazate which must be one of the most splendid car journeys in Africa.  From minus 1 to 9 degrees in an hour or so and vice versa. The High Atlas mountain roads are superb. This hotel is weird in a nice sort of way.    The restaurant empty as was the hotel but don't be put off. Huge swimming pool and the city is an interesting one especially if you want to visit the film studios that abound.  Bit of a disney building reminds me of those old hotels in North AFrica from the past maybe fifty years ago.  The Rif in Tangier and old Mamounia in Marrakesh as it was before the renovations.

"We stayed here one night after our trip in the desert and on our way to Marrakech.  The hotel is huge and seems ""grand,"" but up close it seems a bit worn and in need of an update.

There is no wifi, only a computer room, and it was very tricky figuring out how to log on.  Comapred to everywhere else we stayed, food was pretty average / slightly below average.  All buffet style.  I suggest the pasta station for dinner, everything else was not so good.

"After having disappointing hotel experiences in both Casablanca and Marrakech, the Berbere Palace was a welcome change. The room was both clean and comfortable. The rooms are showing some signs of wear, but are quite nice.  Roses on the nightstand; robe in the room. Lovely grounds.  Friendly staff. Good food. Be sure to check out all the kitchy movie memorabilia around the hotel. The only negative was the sounds from outside starting at 6 am (doors opening/closing, bag carts rolling, etc.).",4.0
"My wife and I stayed here for a night before going on a desert tour - the reception staff were really unfreindly and unhelpful (didn't give us any introduction to the facilities, my wife waited 30 minutes in the reception area for a cup of tea), our room was ok but definitely not the standard we expected from a supposedly 5 star hotel, the rooms were very dated and most of the hotel is the same.   The food was quite poor, staff unfriendly (apart from the cleaners who actually acknowledged us), it was a really weird atmosphere, even the guests didn't make any eye contact let alone say hello! It reminded me of the hotel in the Shining, but with less charm.  I would recommend you avoid this place, there's a hotel 2 minutes down the road which is of a similar standard (i.e. not…",1.0

Now any place will get old after that long however the here are some of the pros/cons Pros: Absolutely AMAZING pool and pool area both during the day and at night. The Hammam was very enjoyable and the breakfast buffet was great.  Service in the restaurant and around the pool was awesome.  Rooms were big.  Bathrooms were big and both were clean.  Cleaning staff were awesome as well.  front desk staff leave a little to be desired with their arrogance and condescending attitude. The rooms are very dated, mattresses not the best.",3.0

"The hotel is at best a 3-star rating, it's only 5 compared to others i guess. I spent 1 night on my own which i had booked independently through an operator, and the second and third nights, i was joining a very large group, of which my partner was part of. There had been a slight mix up, which resulted in me having to enquire about booking the additional 2 nights directly with the hotel - which they quoted me more than 4 times the price i had paid for the 1st night. We managed to sort out this mix up, as the group found my room booking - because of this mix up, we were then asigned to the worst room I have ever seen, at the very back end of the hotel, with dirty sheets, wet towels and no working shower. I was forced to complain, and was then thrown a new key accorss the…",2.0

"The attractive and expansive common areas make for disappointment with the rooms. The property itself consists of seemingly endless choices of bars, restaurants, pools, fountains, and gardens. However, the rooms are disappointing and much in need of an update. My room looked like Holiday Inn circa 1985, dull and with outdated burgundy velour decor. Ick. This was disappointing because Le Berbere Palace is operated by the same company that runs the lovely and consistent La Tour Hassan hotel in Rabat.",3.0
"Before starting I must say that I generally dislike big hotels. I booked a ridiculously expensive room at Le Berbere Palace just because my mother swore that it was the only accomodation in Ouarzazate (my bad, I wish I had checked the internet before). Not only Le Berbere Palace is a huge outdated hotel, but it is also tacky and charmless, reminding me of the worst face of colonialism. It resembles a turist village more than a hotel: indipendent cottages, three or four restaurants, swimming pool, bar...everything whithin the structure so you could be tempted to spend your days inside and never go out and see that gem in the desert that is Ouarzazate.",2.0
"On the day that we checked into Le Berbere Palace Ouarzazate, there was an entourage of the Moroccan King staying in the hotel as well.  Hence, it couldn't be that bad especially when we had a worse experience at a hotel near the Sahara.  The first impression was lots of Hollywood props.  The hotel uses props from Hollywood blockbusters to decorate the common area.   We checked into the hotel at about 7pm and the lack of signboards to the rooms was distressing.  The rooms are housed in two-storey buildings around the hotel main building.  You have to walk out of the main lobby in order to get to your rooms.   The poor use of signs made us walking round blocks searching for our room.  We wasted more than 30 mins just to get to the room.  But after we got into the room, the…",3.0

Wonderful breakfast, all the service we encountered was excellent especially the food and beverage staff and our room was great. I would agree with other reviews that it needs a bit of a make over but it doesn't detract from the blue skies and sunshine!  Unfortunately like many places in Morocco, there is not much in the way of restaurants etc outside the hotel yet I can imagine after being there a week (we stayed 3-nights) the menu may get a bit tiresome.",3.0

I stayed here on two separate nights the first room was perfectly acceptable but average the second a superior room much better. The staff were fine, neither great or poor, they did their job to my satisfaction. The restaurant was serving a buffet which in place like this can be bad, but it was fine. Good selection and good quality.  Everything in this hotel is expensive. I am guessing its because they class it as a five star (its not) and because the town is remote.  The prices are not justified, but if…",3.0
"We were very hesitant about the Le Berbere Palace hotel as our A & K agent felt it was not up to standards.  We must say we found the hotel really quite nice.  We had a lovely, large room with a great bathroom and all the amenities one could ask for.  It’s not  a 5 star hotel, but it is very nice and, like so many of the previous reviews, we wished we could have stayed an additional night.  For us, like many others, it was just a weigh station on our trip to Marrakech.  I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s the best hotel in Morocco, clearly it’s not, but it’s far from the worst.  It’s a fine hotel for one or two nights on your way to or from the Sahara and, I believe, the best in Ouarzazate",4.0

"Ok.  Living as an expat in Morocco for the past 18 months, I can tell you that Moroccan hotels are not great.  Service usually is terrible even at the ""5-star"" hotles.    However, Berber Palace is an exception.  I found out during my stay that I had a serious issue with my taxes that needed immediate resolution.  I was 600 km away from my tax attorneys.    The hotel staff assisted me by finding some palce in Ouazarzate that could get me the right tax forms and arrange for courrier service so that I could get the right forms  (signed) to my attorneys the very same day.

"Where to start? Let's just say Le Berber Palace is possibly the LAST place I would stay in Ouarzazate. Granted we went in the 'off-season.' And the town really isn't much.   It's labeled as a 5 star hotel. I'm not sure what planet that would be on. It was so bad we checked out after one night and took an overnight bus back to Marakech. And we were staying in a PREMIUM ROOM.  Here are the highlights...  - it's outrageously expensive - the hotel down the road is just as nice for 1/3 of the price. - they say they take American Express but kept telling us that our Amex cards (three different ones) were being declined and that we had to pay with a Visa/Mastercard or cash.

I was in a 2 floor suite and it was amazing. Very clean, cute moroccan decor, 2 bedrooms, one on the ground floor and one upstairs. The master bedroom, upstairs, was huge with a large bathroom, living space and bedroom area. Downstairs had another separate living room, separate large bedroom and a separate large bathroom.

Sitting by the pool at night under the clear sky on a plush lounge with a cold drink is pure heaven. After a short walk down a garden path you will arrive at your room.

The bedrooms are dowdy and depressing, with holes in the drapes which didn't cover the windows. Rotting wood around the windows in the bathroom, a shower curtain that was desperately in need of replacement, inconsistent water temperature in the shower and somewhat threadbare towels.

They told 2 really known hollywood acters but I believe that these are sensitive private information and shouldent be spread by the hotel employees.

It was a very big hotel for Morocco and the only 5* hotel that we stayed in for the tour. It was also the most disappointing; the staff were very offhand, verging on surly and it didn't have a good atmosphere. In the evening there was a buffet with attractive food, but we both developed gastro-enteritis the next day, the only time we had trouble in two weeks.  There was a huge tour group staying, who dressed up in what looked like paper bedouin clothes in the evening; we were glad that they were not British! ",2.0

With absolutely no bargaining power, we asked the front desk for a discount, and got a room for about $130 US, as I recall, which was much less than the rate he had just quoted us. He also upgraded us to a two story suite, since maybe he took pity on these dirty travellers, and also since the hotel was almost devoid of guests.

"This tastefully restored kasbah is just the place to relax and unwind after a desert trek.  We were greeted by the manager with a happy smile and, of course, mint tea.  The clean rooms are beautifully decorated in traditional style, with modern touches.  Superb evening meal, accompanied by local musician.   Be patient when waiting for hot water for shower- it will come! Just wish I could have stayed a bit longer to explore local area.",5.0
"I was working around the area and stayed in this amazing and very nicely decorated Kasbah.  The decor is very traditional, with the interior of the rooms and bathrooms also decorated very nicely, really a wonderful place to stay.  Beds are comfy also!  Shower takes a few mins to warm up but is perfectly fine.  Free wifi is available in the Kasbah and dining area too.  The food served is also very tasty and you will not go to sleep hungry that's for sure!  Food ranges from a variety tagines to brochettes with chips.  A traditional musical performance by Abdul will take place after the dinner and guest participation is highly encouraged!  The owners Abdul and Mohammed are very nice and accommodating, even though they didn't speak English.    Most people stay for one night just…",5.0
"Travelled around Morocco frequently for research. Stayed in Ait Ben Hada several times whilst travelling through the area. Clean rooms, compfy bed. Food is good and for longer stays there is good variety for evening meals. Staff are friendly and entertaining. Would recommend as a place to stay for stop over or for a few nights.",5.0
"Great, easy to find location, with fantastic views of the surroundings. The staff was really helpful and friendly. Although their english is a bit limited and so is our french, we were able to communicate just fine. The dinner and breakfast were delicious. After dinner Abdul gave us some drumming lessons, which was a fun experience.  They have also arranged a guide for us (which was also Abdul), who took us to the palmerie. Crossing the river with our Peugeot 301 was one of the best moments in two weeks of Morocco. Would definetly stay here again.",5.0
"My experience of the hotel was very positive. The staff was exceedingly welcoming and helpful, although their English was limited. Breakfast and dinner were very good. Easy to find (two signs by the road). Perhaps the only drawback was that wifi was not very strong in the room, but this is really a minor issue.",4.0
"Lovely secluded location in the oasis, with a terrace with a view from which we watched the sun set over the mountains and palm trees. The hotel is extraordinarily clean and comfortable, with traditional decor.  The best part though, was the food. We were given enormous portions of delicious food for dinner and breakfast - the best meals of our week in Morocco. Breakfast included an enormous piece of bread baked traditionally in a wood oven.  Not only is the hotel fantastic, is also locally/family owned and staffed - in the interest of sustainable and responsible tourism try the cosy Ait Ben Hada.",5.0
"We stayed there for two night and everything was over our expectations: room and bathroom super comfortable and clean, dinner and breakfast among the better we had in Morocco (also the quantity were huge, we never succeded to finish a course...). Abdoul is a wonderful host, he entertained us with music and berber tea and also was our guide for a day tour in skoura's palmeraie, souq and kasbah. You can't find anything comparable to in Morocco (and maybe outside ...).",5.0
"Initially the plan was to drive from Mzarrkesh to the Erg Chebbi dunes and stopver for one night at a half way point.. We booked Ait Ben Haddou situated about 5 miles before the quiet town of Skoura. The manager did attempt to call as we arrived later than our 7pm estimated arrival and throughout communication efforts were good, despite him not speaking English. The accommodation itself is up a gravelly desert road signposted by painted arrows on the walls. In the dark, you just have to be alert for the signage.  The room was on the first floor of this Kasbah. We travelled just before the newyear so heating was necessary at night and this was available. The room was basic but served the need. There was a shower, which just needed the hot water to be run for a while to heat up.…",3.0
"This hotel is very cozy, typical bereber kasbah style. Rooms are big and comfortable. People are very friendly and made us feel at home. We stayed there as part of our roadtrip arround Morocco. There is nothing special in Skoura, but is a good place to stop between Todra/Dades valleys and Marrakech. ",4.0
"Very nice place, Abdul was singing playing drums and very, very good food. Mohamed is very friendly. Nice and clean rooms with hot shower. It's calm place, to runaway from big cities. I recomend it to everyone who wants to have a little bit of peace and just listening to the birds in the morning and watching nature. the city is oaza of palms and as the locals say, it is the best to visit in may because of the flowers and they are offering a lot of beber whiskey.",5.0
"We stayed one night in this beautiful renovated Kasbah. We were treated like kings in their own castle. They cooked as an amazing dinner and breakfast, we played music together and they showed us the amazing palmerie and Kasbah almridil. Abdul and Abdulah are great hosts and really friendly. Don't miss the stars at night in the rooftop terrace. The only suggestion would be to have heating in the room as it was a bit cold during the night... We'll hopefully come back",5.0
"The kasbah is build in the style of an old Berber castle in a rather remote area. Abdul and his colleagues are the most welcoming hosts. We were the only guests when we were staying there and the staff really did everything to make our stay the perfect experience. They prepared a fantastic diner and we played music together afterwards which was really great. As the kasbah is not surrounded by many other buildings, one has fantastic view on the stars. If you are staying there, you should also take a short trip to the nearby oasis and old kasbah. The staff can give you a tour.  Thank you again for the wonderful stay, guys!",5.0
"We had a super time in Ait Ben Hada. Great and very helpful owner, nice and clean rooms. He did everything he could to make our stay as comfortable and personal as possible. Freshly and delicious cooked food. Good Price-quality.  We highly recommend this fine kasbah! Good place for planning trips to the dade and rose valley, the dunes and Ouarzazate.",5.0
"We stayed for a week in May on business. This modern kasbah has been tastefully built just off the main road so its easy to find and has great views across the oasis to the Atlas Mountains. The owner was really friendly, helpful and welcoming telling us to make ourselves at home. Tea on tap and a very spacious room made this a pleasurable base.",5.0
"My mother and I sadly spent only one night in this beautiful kasbah.  The room was one of the largest we had on our entire trip, and it was beautifully decorated.  The gentleman who assisted us didn't really speak English or Spanish, and we didn't speak French or Arabic.  Didn't matter!  We chatted and managed to understand each other through hand gestures and smiles.  We also loved the welcome cookies he brought with the mint tea.  They were homemade and had a great anise flavor.",5.0
"Hotel and restaurant situated on a exceptional place in the near of Ouarzazate. Very good meals and friendly staff. New kasbah, with young family who gives you a personal treatment, advices or organisating trips. Also nice to stay three nights, as a base to visit the dades valley and to make a day trip to the desert.",5.0
"We happened to find this beautifully built kasbah by chance, when we passed with our rental car and followed a sign on the street. Of all the accommodations in Morocco we've seen till now, this one was certainly one of the most beautiful and welcoming. The hospitable owner told us proudly that he'd opened about one year ago, after more than 5 years of constructing the kasbah in traditional style.   From the rooftop we had a fantastic view during sunset. The interior is nicely decorated with many beautiful details (without being too kitsch). The food tasted delicious, as everywhere in Morocco. And the service was very welcoming and friendly. Last but not least, we were happy to have an airco (which served as a heating) and wifi (not always working inside the room but everywhere…",5.0
"We were here only a night, in December, just after Christmas. It was an amazing place to stay, the room were warm, the conditioner worked fine and the wifi was good both in the room and in the restaurant. I definitely recommend this place. Everyone was so nice to us, both during the diner / which was really good , and a huge bread we could not finish / and during the breakfast with an amazing pressed orange juice (not a bought one from the market) .  For the day after they recommended us the near kasbah which we visited, it would have been a mistake to miss it!   recommend absolutely.   oh and the sunset from the roof is breathetaking !",5.0

"We had a wonderful night’s stay at the Ait Ben Hada in October.  It’s situated on a little hill just off the main highway, a kilometer or two west of the center of Skoura, and the rooftop offers wonderful views of the surrounding palmery and mountains.  The rooms were nicely decorated and clean, and the spacious bathrooms had showers with reliably hot water, which we discovered was something of a rarity in Morocco, at least in the mid-range places.  The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, and the dinner was one of the best we had in any of the hotels and guesthouses we stayed in.  To top it all off, when I forgot my iPod touch on a bench outside the hotel, they worked with a hotel we stayed at in Merzouga (the Kanz Erremal, also a great place to stay) to have it sent…",5.0

The auberge has one kasbah-style building with various large rooms, each with a spotless private bathroom (normal toilet, nice hot shower that just takes about 5-10 minutes to warm up but is then really hot) and beautiful decor, extra cozy blankets, AC/heater, etc. The building is actually brand new, and adjacent is the restaurant, kitchen, which is more glamorous than we were looking for with white table cloths. We had a delicious couscous soup for dinner, the best I had in all of Morocco, very hearty and homemade - and in the morning were served…",5.0
"My wife and I had a very difficult night's stay in Merzouga. Quick point to all readers - follow Tripadvisor to select a camp in Merzouga. They all have similar sounding names and we ended up confusing ourselves and selected a camp on Booking.com (Sahara Dream Luxury Camp) which is not on TripAdvisor. Why a disaster! Stay way!  After Merzouga (we ran away after night one when we were booked for two), we needed a restful place to relax and recharge. Chez Talout proved to be the perfect place. We were warmly greeted by Rizwan. Rizwan has a pleasant smile, a welcoming attitude and aims to please. He asked us to select a room of our choice and we did - with the maximum light. We rested around the pool, took a nap, went for a quick swim and then recharged in the Hammam. The Hammam is an extra charge but it was something my wife and I needed.   Soon it was dinner time. Rizwan's sister, Rasheeda, is the head chef and is highly creative with her cooking. My wife had requested a few vegetarian dishes for dinner and Rasheeda and her team did an excellent job. I had the Chicken Tajine - a wonderfully flavorful dish. The Moroccan appetizers were just too many and everything was high on flavor. We did not have alcohol with our dinner but had some in our room which we enjoyed afterwords by ourselves.   The night was relaxing and we slept very well. The hotel is quite secluded and we were so pleased to have a quiet night as we got ready for the hustle and bustle of Marrakech.   The next day we met Abdou (owner/manager) over breakfast. He is a kind man with an easy smile and a pleasant attitude. Abdou leads the team at Chez Talout well. The breakfast is served on the Terrace and we enjoyed the Palmerie views while having a light and easy start to the day.   We wish we stayed longer. As we left the property Abdou gave us a map and showed us how and where to drive for the best High Atlas experience. With some courage and plenty of twists and turns it was a fun drive.   We think of our stay and experience at Chez Talout as one of the highlights of our travels to Morocco. We highly recommend this hotel for its staff, for its food, for its quiet surroundings and just overall bliss….if that’s what you are looking for.…",5.0
"It was just for one night but what a great night it was! We met the brother of the owner and he was very attentive the whole stay! I wanted to run in the morning and he showed me how to get in and out of the front gate. The food was excellent (He even had a bread made just for us to take with us!) We loved that they don't waste the food as they gave us so much and we could not finish it all. The grounds were immaculate, the room was roomy and with a frig!, and the staff was wonderful.

Our room was a Moroccan style, very spacious and comfortable. The hotel arranged a tour for us to the palmery which was informative and a great day outside watching people go about their daily life.

"I was there for one night in mid-November as i traveled from Erg Chigaga to Marrakesh.  Staff was excellent.  Rooms and amenities were very good.  My room was spacious and very nicely decorated.  The price was reasonable.  Abdul (the owner general manager I believe) was extremely nice and very helpful.  So was the rest of his staff. The biggest and best surprise about this place as the food - especially the dinner.  I had picked this place because of its location and amenities.  I really didn't pay much attention to the restaurant component.  Nonetheless, I ended up having dinner there and it was absolutely fantastic. (And, by the way, the cost of dinner was included in the room!)  I was in Morocco for 19 days and many of them provided access to restaurants.  The Chez Talout dinner was the best meal of the trip, and its taste would easily rival even the best meals I have had in restaurants around the world.  I won't go into to detail, but it was both simple and complex.  It took the Moroccan staples ""tangine""  and ""salad"" to a completely new and fantastic level!!! I saw on checkout that they offer cooking classes.  I have never taken cooking classes, but this meal was so special that even being from the States I would consider making the trip just to learn their approaches.  (I was sorry I was staying only one night - perhaps I could have convinced them to let me take a ""class"" another night.  Anyway, DO NOT MISS THIS RESTAURANT! Sorry, I was yelling.…",5.0

Off the main road in the village of Skoura , Chez Talout stands out like an oasis of comfort and tranquility offering excellent, spacious accomodation for the weary travellers.  We arrived rather late in the afternoon after a long and tiering journey and we were welcomed by a lovely green and refreshing garden with a perfectly clear swimming pool and a spacious and comfortable room, graciously adorned with rose petals.

We stayed for 6 nights and this allowed us to enjoy the beautiful rooms, pool, surroundings and above all the variety of excellent meals prepared at the hotel.   It also gave us the time to make several visits as suggested by Abdou: some close by in the village (great experience for our 8 year son in the local pottary), to make walks in the beautiful Oasis or to visit Ouarzazate.

"First, a quick note on how to find it. If you drove in or to the city limits of Skoura, you went too far. Go back up the road from Skoura toward Ouarzazate a few kilometers and keep looking for a big ""Chez Talout"" sign that points to a gravel road. That's your road. It's essentially on the outskirts of where all the palm trees are, which is slightly misleading in a way.   Chez Talout is an impressive mansion perched high up on a hill outside of the palm trees of Skoura. This gives it a rae 360 degree view of everything from desert, to the Atlas mountains, to the town, to the palm grove below. It's really the most spectacular view you can get around Skoura, or many places of Morocco to be honest.   It's a large hotel in terms of grounds, and they really seem to try to cater to…",5.0

The manager was very welcoming and helping, who arranged the documents and room promptly. The layout of this restaurant/residence could be considered grandiose as it offered a decent-sized pool, a small, ornamental fountain and many green plants. It was a shame that we could not take good advantage of these facilities due to the low temperature in winter. The room was very big but the hot water in the shower seemed to be insufficiently hot in the cold winter days. The dinner was only 60% of the price in the cities but had a lot more to offer, including a large portion of vegetables and rice, tajine chicken and fruit dessert. The residence was on a vantage point. Thus…",5.0

He insisted that it was ok but finally went to our room.  It was fixed properly finally but he claimed it was our fault.  Really?!  In need of hospitality training.

The staff were friendly and certainly not demanding in a Marrakechish way for tips.  We interacted with Abdul, the brother of Chez Talout's owner.  He was instructive and helpful for our questions.  Room-wise, we felt the Chez was spacious. We stayed in a suite which had an extension. This was ideal for us to place our toddler in. Chez also offers baby cots which is a plus for those travelling with young children.  Location-wise, it is near to famous landmarks in the Skoura Oasis area such as the Amerhidi Kasbah which we visited the morning we left. …",5.0
"Pros: - very nice terraces, garden and great pool (unbelievable, being in the desert!) - Abdou, the manager, is lovely and so is the rest of the staff - nice welcome tea and pastries upon reception - the dinner by the pool is great (Moroccan salads, a delicious chicken tajine and fruits for dessert) price was 120dhs per person. - the breakfast in the big terrace is nice - our room had a nice private terrace and bathroom is big  Cons: - we would have loved some eggs at breakfast, but this is a minor detail. - the room was below expectation compared to the rest of the hotel: the bathroom feels quite rudimentary, and the AC in the room did not work well. We slept with open terrace door and window because it was a particularly hot night. - we kindly suggest to remove the toilet seat…",4.0
This hotel is far from the main road. You take a dirt road to reach it. The hotel is quite isolated and therefore not noisy. You can get a great view of the night sky. The rooms were dated but clean. The staff were accommodating. Breakfast was good.,4.0
This was a nice stop during our tour of Morocco. Hotel had all the facilities you need including a lathe swimming pool. Had a lovely dinner and breakfast at this hotel. Our group were the major occupants so we were free to use everything at our discretion. Stayed only for one night. Not much to do around the hotel and access is a bit tough for big busses. ,5.0
"This hotel is located outside of Skoura, overlooking the palms. Pool area is very nice, rooms are very dated but comfortable enough. The food is okay but not great. Staff were friendly and helpful and provided some good advice for local touring.",3.0
We stayed for only one night but wanted to stay for much longer. The staff was very welcoming and the chicken tagin was heavenly.   The only down part is the bumpy road getting there. But the hotel is defineatly worth it :) i can only recommend this beautiful hotel!,5.0
"Fantastic lodge on the top of a sandy Hill overlooking the green valley and river bed. From the start Abdou and his colleagues make you feel completely at home, being there for you every moment of the day, in a very friendly and relaxed way. Rooms are very spacious, set up in traditional local style. Perfect for us as a family of 4. The court yard is well layed out with a crisp and cool pool, lots of places to be seated or to lay down, in the sun as well in the shade. Plus are the activities such as the fitness room and game ""patio"".  Enjoy your breakfast and the rooftop terrace overlooking the valley and take the opportunity to have dinner there as well, the chicken lemon tajine was the best tajine we had in Marocco (we had a couple). Let Abdou advise you on the different…",5.0
The place has a 360° view over the Skoura palmeraie. The garden is very nice with rosmarine and roses everywhere The room has a very big window and coloured carpets on the floor Thanks to Abdou for his helpful suggestions,5.0
My family and I had two great resting days at Chez Talout. Mr Talout goes to extra lengths to please its customers so his staff. Children are very welcome. The swimming pool and play areas keeps them busy for hours. The food is good and abundant! The hotel is a great base to discover the oasis as well as the local pottery shop run by Mohamed 2 min away on foot. The workshop is really good and not commercial.   ,5.0
Chez Talout is a very proper place to stay. Rooms are real good. Bathroom is very good. Food areas are top. Breakfast is top. Pool is great as are all the open areas. Snoker and table football free :-) The only downside is that it is not inside the palm tree and is away from any point of interest. ,5.0
"Nice place, nice room, nice staff. Nothing out of the ordinary, but very much acceptable for the price. Tip: Don't rely on Google maps for getting there. There is a (good quality) un-paved road for getting there which doesn't exist in their map.",4.0
"A highlight of our trip exploring Morocco, Chez Talout is a real gem.  A calming sanctuary under a blue sky by the Skoura oasis, with endless peaceful rambles in the palmerie, great views of the oasis against a backdrop of snowy high atlas, and fantastic welcoming hosts.  The food is superb too, raising the bar for hotel gastronomy nationwide.  Though be warned that you'll never be happy with another tajine after tasting Chez Talout's marvels - all others are mere imitators. Oh, and did I mention the Hamam? We'll be back.",5.0
"Surely the best place to stay in Skoura oasis. With  stunning views from the oasis, a walking distance from it, you have a beautiful hotel, with pool, yards, excellent rooms and a very helpful staff. It was a great choice and with great value",5.0
"We spent 4 wonderful days at this truly unique kasbah. This is an excellent choice if you are looking for an authentic Moroccan experience with spectacular views of the desert and Atlas mountains. The kasbah is located atop a hill in the desert oasis of Skoura (about 30 minutes from Ouarzazate airport) and the Talout family takes great pride in welcoming their guests and sharing their hospitality. The rooms are clean and large with all the basic facilities. The kasbah's panoramic balcony with its 360 degree view of the jaw dropping scenery is an amazing spot for breakfast and to watch the evening sunset over the Atlas mountains. The pool area is lovely and relaxing. As it is remote, we ate both breakfast and dinner at the kasbah. The food (traditional berber dishes - tangines,…",5.0
"We just stayed for 5 days in this beautiful, and amazing place. Like a fairytale!! Beautiful scenery, very friendly staff who go out of their way to make you comfortable, excellent food, clean rooms, great place for children and lots of fun and interesting cultural activities that can be organised from the hotel. Great place for young and old, safe for children who loved the activities such as donkey riding, pottery. The journey towards Skoura from Marrakesh is also breathtaking!!! A pearl in the desert!!!

"We spent 5 days here with the entire family to celebrate a wedding anniversary. We had a fantastic time. Nicely decorated, spacious rooms, many amenities for young and old, great cooking and lovely people who take care of all your needs. Last but not least: a fairly-like location! One of these rare, hard to imitate, extraordinary experiences.",5.0
"The experience started prior to our arrival, with a very nice communication with Abdou, who gave us lots of details about the property to accommodate our group of 12 with 5 kids, and the possible activities to be done in Skoura. This service was extremely precious and made the trip really easy to plan! The property itself is great, airy, comfortable and nicely decorated. The service is in the same spirit: welcoming and full of attention Highly recommended place. Best  Imre",5.0
"Perhaps the biggest surprise of our weeklong trip in Morocco was the charming, quiet palm grove town of Skoura.  If you need a break from the hustle and bustle of Fes or Marrakech, Skoura is the perfect antidote.  And the perfect hotel in this town is Chez Talout.  Perched on top of a hill overlooking snow capped mountains and the grove, you will have a fantastic dinner and breakfast and relax in really nice rooms.  The staff was very accomodating on the food requests of one of our family member (vegan).  We  went in winter so could not enjoy the pool but would love to come again when it is warmer.  The staff was excellent.  Highly recommend.",5.0
"Chez Talout is a bit off the main road, but it's definitely worth the (short) detour. The location is quiet, and the hotel itself is wonderful: the rooms are beautifully decorated; we had the impression of being hosted in a little palace. The garden is kept with the same eye for detail, and the food they serve is invariably delicious - do not miss a chance to try the chicken and lemon tagine! Staff is very welcoming and helpful, Abdou really made us feel at home in this family-run hotel and gave us good advice on which places to visit in the neighborhood. We had a perfect stay!",5.0

"What can I say? I loved this hotel. From the offset they could not do enough for us. The hotel itself is a mini kasbah on a dirt track (dont worry - we thought what have we done whilst bumping along but it is so worth it). The owner Abdul was a friendly and genuinely lovely host (as were his staff). The pool was not massive but cool and wonderful. The terrace gave a beautiful view. So many little things I loved: bats in the evening flying - I even heard one squeaking! The silence, the dust devil that blew across the pool while we were in it were amazing. We met some carpet weaving ladies and laughed and laughed. We did pottery, Abdul even walked us there and introduced us - all 5 minutes away! The hotel arranged an hour long camel ride at dusk which was amazing (the kids loved…",5.0
"I have travelled extensively and stayed in many places, from rooftop dormitories in India to 5 star hotels in Tokyo or London but Chez Talout was my best  ever experience. The customer focus of the entire team is so genuine and of such an outstanding quality that our entire family enjoyed this part of our Morocco experience to the max. Next to the effort from the team there is the unbeatable views from the location and the things to do in the vicinity. Skoura is a hidden gem in Morocco because of its location and within a circle of 80km around you can visit and discover the most beautiful places from the local oasis, khasbas and pottery artisans almost next to the hotel to the must do things like Vallée de Dadés, Ouarzazat, Ait ben Haddou, the mountains near Vallée des Roses,…",5.0
"Chez Talout is situated on the top of a little hill outside Skoura and is the perfect place to relax and enjoy and to experience genuine moroccan hospitality in a familiar atmosphere.

"We stayed at Chez Talout for one night on our way to Merzouga.  As soon as we arrived, the owner welcomed us with some mint tea by the pool- a wonderful way to relax after an afternoon in the car.  The guesthouse is gorgeous, with an incredible view and a beautiful pool and grounds.  The food (dinner and breakfast) was also delicious.  The owner was very gracious and welcoming, and I truly felt at home while staying here.",5.0

"Having previously spent a day in Paris (Hyatt Vendome) at the rate of 830 euros, yes per night, this hotel was equal or better in many ways.  We were given good driving directions, only 3 km on the dirt, and received a very warm welcome by Abdelouahab (owner). The accommodations were perfect, the pool clean and inviting, suburb  meals and all at a very reasonable fare.  MAYBE is you ask Abdelouahab he can prevent any clouds from passing, we had two during our entire stay.  This was by far our best stay in our two week drive over the Atlas mountains.",5.0
"We stopped here after a desert excursion and boy, what a treat! It is a beautiful property not far from the Skoura oasis. It was bright and colorful with flowers around the property in bloom - a nice contrast to hours of desert. The owner is charming and gracious. We immediately felt welcome.  The room, which had a double and single bed as well as a sleeping porch with two single beds was comfortable and quiet. Everything was very clean. The pool was wonderful after so much time on the road.   The food was the best we had in Morocco - in particular the preserved lemon chicken tagine! Delicious.  Time your stay so you can watch the sunset from the terrace. Our only regret was that we couldn't stay longer.",5.0
"Excellent hotel with very friendly staff.  Great breakfast. It is in the middle of nowhere,  offering high level of confort with great view on the desert.

"We stayed here just one night during a 3 day 2 night tour of the Morocco countryside. The host was extremely friendly and made us feel very welcomed to the place. Luckily, we had the place entirely to ourselves as March was off season for them. The place is beautiful, though we didn't have much time to spend here. The rooms were beautifully decorated, beds were comfy and the bathrooms were great. The hot water was hot and had plenty of pressure which we appreciated after being in a van all day long.  Most of all, the food was exquisite and was one of the best dinners we had in all of Morocco.",5.0

Excellently furnished, big bed room with separate bath (of course). We had a small living room as well. Very good pool, fairly big hamman and other facilities. Delicius cooking and very professional management by the owner. He really made us feel at home. We enjoyed every minute in the hotel and on our excursion in the city of Skoura.",5.0

Owner Abdou and manager Soffiane will make sure that you have the best services during your stay. The view and the food are awesome. Make sure you check out the Bread Lady in the morning who bakes the fresh hot bread for your breakfast. The dadas in the kitchen prepare the tasty meal for your stay. Must Stop into the Valley.,5.0
"We really enjoyed our week spent at ""Chez Talout"". We were warmly welcomed by Sofiane and his team who made us feel like at home. The breakfasts were great, the dinners even better with some of the best traditional meals. Our 3 children also really loved the venue and specially the various play areas. It was nice to be able to let them wander without worrying of their whereabouts. Their only quibble was the swimming pool not being heated (not so much of an issue if you visit between April and October) Each day Sofiane took the time to discuss with us our program and also suggested many sites to visit. We also appreciated his great sense of humour. Their beautiful hammam is also a must-try. We will definitely return.",5.0

From the welcome tea on the roof terrace to their interaction with our children, they did everything right. Definitely recommending this one!",5.0

Could not have asked for a better experience in Skoura.,5.0
"This place  is a bit out of the way unless you have a car. However, it overlooks the oasis and could be considered a great spot to ""prop and stop"" for a while. We stayed only 2 nights but could have happily enjoyed staying a week! Large terrace overlooking the oasis  The pool is a decent size and there are several sun lounges and shade provided. There is also a playground for children and a hammam (if requested). The food is excellent, plentiful and varied. Different breads baked each day on the premises. Great fish salads, taglines and brochettes. No alcohol is served but I noted that some other guest had brought their own and this did not seem to be a problem. Sofiane could not do enough to make our stay pleasant.",5.0

Diner and breakfast were great aswell. Because there were no other guests we could check out whenever we wanted .

The views from the terrace where we sat to drink tea on arrival and ate our breakfast the morning we left were delightful!  We also really enjoyed swimming in the pool after a long day of travelling and sightseeing. The only reason we gave them a 4 instead of a 5/5 was that the shower flooded but I would still stay there again and HIGHLY recommend anyone travelling to stay there. Thank you so much for your hospitality, we hope to come back one day and stay longer! Shukran!",4.0
After a day of driving over the Atlas Mountains our guide delivered us to this piece of paradise in the desert. What a pleasure to find such  beautiful accomadation in the middle of no where. We were made to feel welcomed as we lounged in the swimming pool before watching the sun set over the desert. The food in the restaurant was excellent and having stocked up with some wine we enjoyed the scrumptious meal. Next day one of the guides from ChecTalout took us out into the palm groove on some bikes. Great fun. By the time we got back we were ready for another swim and lunch before returning to Marrekesh that evening.,5.0

Sitting on the roof terrace you can see the Atlas mountains, the Palmeraie, the small village of Oulad Arbia and the best sunrise and sunset I have ever seen. Chez Talout has a variation of places to sit and relax in the sun or shadow, close to the pool (perfect for a swim on a hot day), on the terrace or in the tent. The auberge has its own hammam, very nice to experience this traditional way of ‘taking a shower’. The women in the kitchen work very hard each day to prepare a very good dinner (and lunch on request) all made with fresh ingredients. The rooms are spacious, clean and nicely decorated. And last but not least the staff (especially Abdou)……",5.0

We explored two days the oasis with him, which was the highlight of our tour through Morocco. In the evening we took dinner in the hotel, the food was really tasty. If you have wine, then you can just take it to the table. The garden is very cozy to sit and to drink something afterwards. We were sorry that we could stay only one night.",5.0
"My friends and I stayed here on our recent Morocco trek and were delighted with it.  The best reason to stay there is ""Crazy Abdul"" (his words). He is the most hospitable, delightful, fun, charming host you could ask for in this part of the world. He really goes out of his way to make sure his guests are happy.  The room was comfortable, very large with a private solarium overlooking the valley.  HUGE views from the terrace and they have all kinds of private tents and terraces for you to enjoy privacy with your meals.  The pool was lovely though not heated (my only complaint) and the gardens were lovely.  The good was wonderful.  I would highly recommend this desert oasis.

"My wife and I stayed here for only one night en route from Merzouga to Marrakech, it was arranged by our hotel in Merzouga (Guesthouse Merzouga) and it was fantastic. Soufian (the manager) sat down with us on arrival, served us dates and tea, welcomed us personally, and told us to make ourselves at home. Our room was excellent, with a panoramic view of the High Atlas, the pool hit the spot, and dinner and breakfast both were excellent. Beautiful spot with a great patio and terrace, great views, and a very friendly staff. ",4.0
"We stayed here just one night, but it was an excellent experience overall. Abdul was really friendly, good-humoured and welcoming. The view is stunning. One thing we really liked is that you can have dinner anywhere in the structure: some chose to eat in the courtyard, some next to the pool, some in the big tent, we opted for the terrace. We enjoyed dinner with a view of the sunset over the palmerie. We had a really early departure the next morning, but Abdul had no problem offering us an excellent breakfast at 5.30 AM. Having breakfast under the Moroccan stars was a rare experience, and an excellent one to conclude our holiday before we headed off for a long drive to the Casablanca airport. Thanks Abdul!",5.0
"We stayed here in March of 2014 just for one night, at the end of a desert trek, with 3 adults and 2 kids, in two rooms.  Chez Talout is really well appointed, the rooms were clean, bed comfy.  The staff was GREAT - took wonderful care of us including getting up at 4:30 a.m. to make us breakfast for 5 a.m. on the day we had to leave early for the airport.  The food was great - they prepared vegetarian options for us, and the kids enjoyed the food as well.  The pool was too cold for us to enjoy while we were there, and we didn't have time to go to the spa but it all looked lovely, and the location is amazing.  The only con I would share is that this place is a good 45 min drive from Ouarzazete where we arrived and left from (and the last 10-15 mins is on a dirt road off the…",4.0
We stayed one night here on our way to the desert.  We had a spectacular view from our room.  The staff was incredibly friendly.  Our meal was fabulous.  Everything was great about this place!  We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!,5.0
"I only stayed here one night but I had a wonderful time. Abdul welcomed us like friends, we had great food with a special care for my celiac friend and the accommodation was fantastic: large room, clean and spacioy bathroom, a small living with sofas overlooking the desert. This place is so unique, settled between the palmeraie and the sand and surrounded by the Atlas mountain. I wpuld definitely recommend it to anyone passing nearby, don't look any further and enjoy this magic place! If I come back I will stay here longer to appreciate the place and the friendliness of the people!",5.0

"A stay for one night or two at Chez Talout has become a key part of my itinerary when travelling to the southern oases and gorges as part of my work. The personal care received from Soufiane and the hotel team means I have no need to worry. The guest-house is in a great location, well-managed, lovely pool and spacious rooms - it also reasonably priced with a mid-budget room rates including dinner (which is necessary as there are no restaurants nearby).",4.0
"I stayed here with my friend in November 2013.  The room was fantastic, really cosy, clean and quiet.  The evening meal that was prepared for us was delicious and our host lit the fire for us in the dining room.  Would definitely recommend people to stay here, and would most certainly return if I was in Morocco again. Thanks for a great stay.",5.0
"We stayed here in October on route from Marrakech to the gorges and then the desert. When first booking the hotel I emailed to see if it was possible to go by road up to the falls. Both managers Soufiane and Abdul were so helpful in giving me advice. I also mentioned it was my birthday. On arrival at the beautiful hill top residence we were greeted and parked our car in the carpark. The view was stunning. We were advised to bring our own beer and wine and where to buy it, they kindly put this in their fridges for us.   We went for a lovely walk around the palmery and some ruins before dinner. After watching a stunning sunset we were taken to the tent for a surprise birthday treat of drums and birthday cake by all the lovely staff.   This was so special. The food here is…",5.0
"Unfortunately I've spent only one day and one night in this beautiful place but it's enough to say that Chez Talout is a great auberge to stay, in an excellent location, with fantastic views of the mountains and the palmaire. The Manager Abdul a very friendly and nice guy, the food was the best I had in Morocco and the home made bread was really special.  The rooms are very spacious and clean and they have recently built a very nice hamman where you can relax for a while.  At tay bil n'anā' is also very good... Thanks a lot Abdul from the 3 Italian brothers :)",5.0
"I was at ""Chez Talout"" with my whole family, a friend of us, told us to go there, because of its beauty and hospitality. But it was even more!! I had the most relaxing weeks in my life! Settled in an amazing scenerie in the desert, but with all the comfort you can imagine, without being posh. The rooms, the pool, the food will overwhelm you, but the best part is the familiar atmosphere. Soufiane, who works there, really became a friend in this short time I spent there. He took care after me, while I was sick and realised every wish we had. We could enter the kitchen and give a helping hand to the kitchen, learning the secrets of marocaine cuisine or just laying beside the pool, enjoying peace and quiet. if you are in marocco, you have to there!!!",5.0
"We arrived unannounced for lunch and was rewarded with the best food cooked there and then of our entire time in Morocco.  Soufiane, the Manager, was fabulous - enthusiastic, amusing and exceptionally helpful.  The hotel seemed to have everything that one would want and with a great view of Skoura, too.  A perfect base for touring the area.  We wished that we had stayed at Chez Talout and not somewhere else!",5.0
"Our experience at Chez Talout was not consistent with most of the other reviews.  It is a nice property in a beautiful setting, however other factors made this less than a great choice for us.    First of all, the gentlemen who seems to be in charge is ""overly friendly"" to be point of being somewhat creepy.  Since the hotel is in a remote location, the only real choice for dinner is at the hotel.  The cost per person was 10 euro, which is not unreasonable, but somewhat high for Morocco.  The problem is, the food was not very good. They served a chicken tagine which was very dry with mushy vegetables.  Overall, the dining experience was mediocre, at best.  When we pulled down the bed cover in our room, I noticed that there was hair on my pillowcase.  Needless to say, we felt a…",3.0
"I absolutely love chez talout and its wonderful staff. I was at home from the moment I arrived! I wish I could have stayed longer. It is situated above the beautiful and fertile oasis of skoura. I walked to the fascinating kasbah amerdil through groves of olives, figs, pomegranate, mint. Its like the garden of eden! Next time Insha'allah!",5.0
"As all the reviews before this have stated: stay here, stay here, stay here! - It is a beautiful space in a beautiful land. The grounds are well kept with lots of little spaces to sit, read, enjoy company, admire the landscape. We had meals in multiple spots, each of which were lovely. - The manager, Souffiene, went above and beyond to make our family feel like we were welcome. He and the whole staff were so great with our brood of children (we were two families traveling together with kids ages 1,2,3 and 5). Moroccan people really love children and we saw it in full play at Chez Talout. He set up a tour of the area on very, very short notice and tried to save us money by doing so. - The food was AMAZING!  My 5 year old is already asking when we are going to go back!",5.0
"I've never been more sure of the definition of ""oasis""; Chez Talout is it. The food is as vibrant and welcoming as the staff, especially the bread they make fresh for breakfast (the perfect amount of chewiness with a touch of wood smoke). Each room is a unique burst of comfort and colour, but an even better option: bring a pillow up to the roof, stretch yourself out, and see stars like you've never seen them before. We arrived to the place quite late at night, and we couldn't find it since it was in the middle of nowhere, our host (soufiane I think was his name) came to us on his motorcycle to show us the way. He was such an amazing host: super funny and extremely helpful. He washed our clothes (we were 8 of us) for 150 dirhams (16 US dollars)!! His washing machine broke at…",5.0

"Beyond the good location,beautiful view and excellent facilities we mostly appreciate the kindness of the most friendly staff we meet while in Morocco with special thanks to Mr Sophian that really knows how to make you feel like home!",5.0
"Souffiane, the manager of chez Tallout is the best hotel host we ever met. He is warm, very friendly, humorous and he knows how to make his guests feel like friends visiting him. He is there when you need him and he knows when you need your privacy. But the management is not the only aspect that makes Chez Talout an oustanding place to visit. The location is superb and guarantees breathaking views. The pool is perfect and dinner was the best we had in Maroc. As far as we are concerned there is no doubt. We recommend Chez Talout stongly. Thank you Souffiane for making our stay truly unforgettable!",5.0
"We spent one night Chez Talout and we will never forget the way we were received by Soufiane. He really is the heart of this place and he is the one who make this Kasbah live. He was incredibly fun, kind and understanding to us, he even let us use his computer as we had to change our itinerary.  The Kasbah itself is very nice, clean and well kept. We enjoyed the pool as well as the terrace. Dinner and breakfast were also very good. Would definitely recommend it, it has to be the best address in Skoura !",4.0
"We really enjoyed our one-night stay in Chez Talout. The auberge itself has a very nice garden complete with two canopied areas contained lounges. There is a roof top terrace looking out to the peaceful surrounding area. We particularly enjoyed watching the stars and just listening to the insects in the quiet night. The room was comfortable, The young owner was most friendly and helpful. The homemade Moroccan soup and chicken couscous were delicious. I read that another reviewer spend 5 nights here. I personally think that is a good idea. You will get to see more of the real Morocco and its people instead of the big noisy commercial one.",4.0
"The overnight stay was included in our High Atlas trip package and it was much appreciated after the the hustle and bustle of Marrakech, long drive and kasbah visits. We loved the view of surrounding areas from the terrace - great to watch sunset/sunrise, enjoy the fresh air, peacefulness. Skoura oasis looks far away but it was not long walk to reach palm grove. Our room was clean and comfortable but the rose perfume was a bit too strong for us - we moved the bowl of rose petals to the little table outside. Dinner was good, in fact, the chicken couscous was the best we had in Morocco! Loved newly baked bread next morning too.",4.0
"Chez Talout is the best place we staid during our trip in Marocco! The auberge is located in a surrounding that is a bit desolated, but sooo beautiful! And there are lots of places to visit using Chez Talout as a base. We stayed at Chez Talout for 5 days and I would have loved to stay longer! The staff is so friendly and helpfull (they treated our two young girls as their own), it felt like being part of the family (which made it even harder to leave...). The meals and breakfast are very good and well prepared. The rooms are nicely decorated and the view from our room was so great I left the curtains open at night. There are lots of places to sit/lie and relax next to the swimming pool or on the terrace or rooftop terras. In the small village adjacent to the auberge is a pottery…",5.0
"Great treatment, excellent homemade food, the room was big and very attended.  We arrived in a difficult period of our travel and the young owner of Chez talout hotel was so kind with us. He called the doctor because I had a stong bellyache. In our  opinion this was our best stay in Morocco. The hotel is nearby a fantastic palm grove and it has a beautiful panorama. I recommend this hotel to everyone. It has also a fantastic swimming pool",5.0
A real little paradise on the edge of the palmerie. We were only there for one night which was not long enough to appreciate it. I dragged the family out on what I thought was a short stroll to see the Kasbahs and irrigated gardens but it was a lot further than I had realised and took up most of our time! I definatley recommend at least 1 day for sight seeings and 1 day to relax by the pool and enjoy the quiet and beauty! The owners were really helpful with our travel plans too. Thank you!,5.0
"We stayed for just one night. Fantastic location with fabulous views, a lovely pool and friendly helpful staff. All the family enjoyed it. The palmerie with the ruined Kasbahs is an amazing spectacle though it is easy to get lost - would recommend taking a guide. Highly recommended.",5.0
"When driving along the 3kms dirt track, you wonder where you are going to end up and the result could not be more surprising because behind those big gates there is a haven.  A beautiful pool, with sun loungers and seating areas, small play ground and the most amazing terrace with a 360 degree view of the palmerie and snow capped mountains and dessert.  Our room was spacious and beautifully decorated in typical Moroccan style, with a view on the mountains, so we didn't even have to get out of bed to see the sunrise!  The food was the most delicious Moroccan food we've ever tasted, all home cooked and beautifully presented.  The service was second to none, definitely 5 star service.  Abdu, Sofian and all the staff were so friendly and helpful even booking horse riding in Skoura…",5.0
"First, the property is in a fantastic location at the edge between Oasis and desert.  A wonderful place to drink in the atmosphere of the region.  Great stargazing at night and the roof top has a good panoramic view to watch the changing light in the desert and surrounding mountains.  The room was huge by Moroccan standards and the beds comfortable.  But the real draw is Sofian.  His hospitality was definitely a highlight of our trip! His gregarious, good-natured personality was both comforting and entertaining.  You get the feeling that there is nothing he won't do to make your stay more enjoyable.  The dinners prepared by his wife were outstanding- a welcome retreat after exploring the palmerie (on bikes with a map that Sofian hand-drew for us).  If you are staying in Skoura,…",5.0
This hotel is very unique and Sofian the owner makes the stay very special. It's not luxurious but definitely an authentic experience with the most incredible atlas mountain views. It was extremely unique and we would highly recommend it!,4.0
"100% on all accounts! Sofiane gave is such a warm welcome and with his good sense of humour and kindness towards our children we felt quite at home after only a few minutes. The hotel has been very thoughtfully planned out to include many areas for relaxing (pool loungers, Berber style tents and sofas, a play area for little children and table football/pool for the older kids). The home cooked food was absolutely delicious - the best Moroccan starter ever- and breakfast on the upstairs terrace was a treat with amazing views in all directions.",5.0
"We stayed 3 nights in this beautiful place, much too short. The hotel is located on the edge of Skoura oasis on one side, on the other side the desert starts. So plenty of easy hiking possibilities. If you want to organize different trips, ask the owner Soufian, he is a great guy, friendly, easy goiing and very helpfull.  Facilities (swimming pool, terrace, children playground) in the hotel are great, the view from the room is stunning: desert and Atlas mountains. On the roof you will get your breakfast while enjoying 360 degree fenominal panoramic views on the oasis, desert and mountains.  Finally every evening you can enjoy the typically Morroccon food (tajin) prepared by Soufian, his wife and staff. Tasty and very healthy!",5.0
"It's worth a visit just to meet Sofiane and experience the warmth of Berber hospitality. Yes, the food is delicious home cooking and very satisfying. The desert view on one side of the property and the Palmeraie on the other is true Moroccan bliss. The pool area has inviting loungers and a Berber style tent with sofas. We stayed two nights. For an off-the-beaten-path experience Chez Talout is charming with cozy, spacious rooms filled with colorful fabrics and pillows. Ours had full windows overlooking the palms in the distance. Minimal bathroom amenities and a too-hard bed didn't detract from the appeal of this auberge that really feels like it’s in the middle of nowhere but has its heart in the right place. Sofiane gave us a tour of the family house located a short walk away…",5.0
"Spent the night here with my fiance' while touring Morocco with Sun Trails. Arrived after dark, quite obviously an out of the way place. No matter. Wonderful grounds, comfy room, romantic setting in cozy lounge-like enclosed terrace for dinner (and breakfast). Excellent food. Extremely friendly host / owner. In the morning, up early to watch the sunrise, which was our first chance to soak in the beautiful location . . . snow capped mountains in one direction, palm grove / trees in another direction, and open spaces for the most part elsewhere. Place has a great vibe. Had a really nice looking pool area which we didn't use due to the season.",5.0
"Having travelled from Merzouga, Skoura was a natural half way stop before going on to explore Ait Benhaddou on our way back to Agadir. We arrived at Chez Talout  in the evening and were welcomed with a delicious three course meal which we ate in traditional Morrocan style. The rooms were clean and comfortable with plenty of hot water. We were made welcome by Sofian and his family who talked to us about sights to see in the local area. In the morning we ate a lovely omelette breakfast in the terasse which was followed by fresh dates and delicious fresh orange juice. One of the greatest pleasures of our stay was spending time with Sofian. I would recommend Chez Talout which was excellent value for money.",5.0
One on the best place we have visited in Morocco.Great localization with 360 * view on  Palmière and Atlas Mountains . Nice chill place  with traditional arrangement. Very friendly crew and a helpfull manager named Soufian. Amazing vegetarian food (in Morocco it is kind of difficult to find good vegetarian meals).,5.0
"We stayed in October 2012. The rooms were beautiful and the swimming pool an absolute luxury. I wasn't feeling very well when we arrived with tummy troubles (as it seems many travellers to Morocco exxperience) and Soufiane couldn't do enough to help me get better, arranging for easy to digest food and large quantities of rosemary tea to keep me hydrated (even bringing it up to the room when I was stuck in bed). They didn't charge any extra for any of these things.   Thank you so much and if we ever return to Morocco we will definitely come here (as you say Soufiane perhaps with a family haha). Oh and if you visit and have any books to spare, Soufiane loves to read English books to improve his languages.",5.0
"If you are anywhere near Skoura, stay at the Chez Talout. It is a beautiful, fun & relaxing. The setting is amazing. The pool is refreshing. the vistas are full of beautiful contrasts. the host is welcoming and vivaceous, and the grounds have multiple venues for doing nothing, in silence. The meals are quite good, or should I say fabulous.  Now, the exclamation point.  When booking our stay, I mentioned that my wife would be celebrating her 40th, er, 50th birthday. Soufiane, the owner, immediately responded with the suggestion of Berber musicians to perform. This was arranged and after a wonderful dinner with other 20 guests, the musicians played. everyone was dancing and having a great time. soufiane then brought out the cake baked by his wife for the occasion.",5.0
"We stayed here for one night on our way to the desert.  We knew that this was not one of the most plush hotels on our tour. On our arrival, we were welcomed with such geniuine enthusiasm that it was impossible not to warm to the place.  Our room was very comfortable and the whole place was spotlessly clean - we were looking carefully because our previous accommodation had been somewhat grubby and was rated more highly.  Dinner was wonderful, Maroccan cuisine, beautifully cooked, as was breakfast the next morning.  A place to be highly recommended.",5.0
"Hello Soufiane and Team Chez Talout,  on our trip through the South of Morocco we stayed at Chez Talout at the beginning of May, 2012. It was wonderful. You made us feel very welcome. The room was very beautiful, dinner and breakfast were excellent. The view from your terrace over the Valley of 1000 Kasbahs is unforgettable. (We had booked via Sahara Services and Edith Kohlbach.) Thank you so much again, all the best! We have written a travel book in German and we recommend Chez Talout very much. Regine and Jochen Reimers from Germany.",5.0
"When you arrive at this hotel, after a few kilometers in a dirt road, the first thing they'll tell you is to feel confortable, to feel at home. After staying there for two nights, we can really tell that we felt Chez Talout our home for a while. The staff is very friendly, there is plenty of space to enjoy and to relax. The rooms are the biggest and most well-decorated we found in Morocco. The common areas of the hotel are also very nice, especially the area by the pool. A place to recommend to everyone.",5.0
"A twisty gravel road leads to Chez Talout. A real ""hotel-diamond"" is hidden at the end of this dirt road. The personal is really friendly and hospitable, generous and delicious authentic dinner  is served (included in price for the room). Large, clean, berber style furnished rooms are awaiting the guests, in small houses around a pool. We spent there one night on the way to the Sahara desert and decided to come back for another night on the way back to Marakesh. That is proof enough for how satisfied we were.  Therefore we warmly recommend this hotel to those who travel accross Marocco towards East, and pass through Skoura!",5.0
"On our second trip to the south of Maroc we have now stayed again two nights this year at ""Chez Talout"".  What can I say? This is for us the best place between Marrakech and the far south of this beautiful country. When we cross the Atlas we are so happy to be welcomed so warm from the whole family and have our first tea on top of the house on the terrace with such a great view over the palm tree valley and to the near Atlas mountaines.  The meals are so typical and excellent in the evening and a day could not start better with a breakfast on this splendid terrace  It is the atmosphere of this hospitable family which makes this place so unique.   Who ever is going to the south of Maroc and is not visiting Chez talout is making a big mistake. M + H",5.0

The heartily welcome of the owner made us feel comfortable from the very beginning and after drinking mint tea and visiting our colourful, beautifully decorated rooms it was so refreshing to dive to the pool! The traditional moroccan dinner was abundant and tasty. Later at night when it was quiet I was standing on the terrace listening to the sounds of the nature and admiring the most beautiful night sky with the brightest stars I´ve ever seen.

The location is a bit tricky, Talout is hard to find, but the reward is that you end up at one of the best places in the whole of Marokko. Chez Talout is a small hotel (8 rooms) run by a very friendly family, with breathtaking views from the terasses over Skoura, a beautiful pool, very large and comfortable rooms, and the meals they cook are among the best in the country. We (my girlfriend and I, together with two Austrian friends) felt very, very welcome at 'Chez Talout', and had a great time there.

Even a playground for real little kids. Very safe, friendly, and super clean/pretty. The photos do not lie! Be aware that the food is served family style, with no menu, and is really delicious and very plentiful. So if you have small kids, you might want to tell them to make you fewer meals (for example, 3 meals for the 4 of us would still have been plenty, with leftovers!), cheaper and less waste that way.

I hope to come back soon for at least one week! really recommended, this is the right place for the perfect holiday!",5.0
"What a wonderful place Chez Talout turned out to be!  Soufiane and his team couldn't have done more to look after us.  We were served delicious food which we ate on a lovely roof terrace with panoramic views to the Atlas Mountains in the North and the Anti Atlas to the South. The garden with the pool, hammocks and shady tented area is a great place to relax after a hot days sightseeing.  The hotel is perched on a rise between the stoney desert and the Skoura Palmerie, away from the main road, very, very peaceful and lovely for early morning walks. We just wish we could have stayed longer!",5.0

We had a great welcome from Soufiane, and loved watching the sunset in the panoramic colorful room upstairs while sipping tea and enjoying snacks.  I'm still remembering how great the food was, homecooked, tasty and so much! That warm salad!   We loved our room, and while it was a little to cold for us to go swimming, the space outside was very comfortable as well.   We loved hearing the stories from the owner, enjoying all the spaces, and relaxing in the fresh air.   Definitely worth it!",5.0

My family including 2 children 8 & 10 spent 4 nights at Chez Talout and cannot speak highly enough of it. The Kasbah was excellent with great food and a faultless attention to our comfort and well being. It was cool at night in Feb (have warm clothes with you) and when they realised the heater in our room was not working we were moved to a warmer room without our even mentioning it. The location of this place was better than any other in the Skoura area as it was situated on the top of a commanding rise spectacularly overlooking the Oasis & Palmerie. I really cannot thank Sofian enough for his genuine and heartfelt warmth of welcome. He stood out from the many other wonderful Moroccans we met and made our stay at Chez Talout remarkable.,5.0

Situated on a small hill you have 360° views over the valley, the Palmière  and the mountains ! Owned by the Talout family and with excellent management we were treated like royalty ! I highly recommend half board due to an excellent chef ! You get the real moroccan food ! We on't forget the diners at the fire place The rooms are simple, clean and very pretty . We had the one overlooking the Atlas mountains ! The pool and all the facilities are in perfect condition ! For us the place to stay and feel a bit of the Moroccan countryside !

"We stayed at Talout on our way back to Marrakech from Mazouga in January 2012.  Having stayed in several riads/kasbahs during our trip, i can say Talout was probably the nicest we found.  The rooms are large and have stunning views of the Atlas Mountains.  Dinner was great, which included live music that we all participated in.  Breakfast was served on the terrace (glassed in for winter), with absolutely stunning views of the mountains and the oasis of palm trees that is Skoura.  It was a little tough finding the place, but their website has directions.  I highly recommend this kasbah.",5.0

The food was very good and the service and welcome excellent. I strongly recommend this place, for its own.  The view from the terrace is splendid and the setting in the evening, having dinner on the terrace very relaxing",5.0
"I travelled by 4x4 from Marakesh with 3 friends, after long day on the road this oasis was a wonderful surprise, fawz soufiane  made us feel so welcome with mint tea and delicious cookies and the setting is beautiful, neat rooms, lovely pool , you just want to sit and stay forever. This was a highlight of our travels in Marocco. Manja Kritzinger travelled with Ninon Robers, Elsie Muller and Thana Whitehead.",5.0

"We started our second travel to Maroc again in Marrakech and got an excellent recommendation for our first stay on our first trip to the south of this great country. So we arrived late in the afternoon at the Auberge Chez Talout in Skoura. We were welcomed like old friends from the family Talout, Adel, his brother and Sofian. Located on the top of a hill just next to the beautiful “Palmeraie de Skoura” the Auberge offered very nice rooms excellent and very tasty dishes with such a friendly service that we decided to come back for our last night in the south before going back to Marrakech after 9 days. It was the best start of our trip and the best end before we left this beautiful part of Maroc.  Merci a la famille pour votre hospitalité marocaine!!!!!! We can recommend this…",5.0
"It’s an excellent place to spend a couple of days. Clean, quiet, close to the Atlas Mountains, kind and careful service. A very good environment for beautiful photos. 100% romantic, the heart of Morocco. Orange juice, salads, traditional bread, tasty couscous, all perfect. Recommended to all our friends, a place we must return to. Many, many tks to Faws Soufiane.",5.0
"Skoura is a perfect base to explore ouarzazate area, todra and dades gorges (as we did). We arrived at night at Chez Talout and we thought to be in the middle of nowhere!  But we woke up the day after and....we said...amazing!!!  The landscape is wonderful, the hotel is confortable and the food is great!!  We saw ""Talout"" only once but we really appreciated the manager of the hotel whose name is Sofian!  He is very kind and does everything possible to make you enjoy your stay. Moreover he explained us a lot of thing about Morocco and Moroccan people! So...if you are planning to visit southern Morocco, We really recommend to go to Chez Talout!",5.0
"The welcome from Sofian (sp?) and the staff at Chez Talout could not have been warmer. Lovely mint tea and cookies after a long drive. The rooms were basic, clean and warm with enough blankets and a heating system. The showers were hot. The dinner was fantastic, wonderful couscous freshly prepared and served next to the fireplace. Breakfast was served upstairs in the ""conservatory"" with a wonderful view over the palmerie towards the mountains. My kids are still eating their boiled eggs with cumin and olive oil as Sofian showed them! We went on a wonderful walk through the palmerie the next morning. My only regret is that we did not stay longer to enjoy more of the area and the facilities at Chez Talout.  The rates are somewhat more expensive for other similar places we stayed on…",4.0
"""Chez Talout"" was the best experience we had on our whole journey through Morocco. We planned to stay for one night ""chez Talout"". We left but even returned to stay for another night. We were treated like kings and felt like part of the family at the same time! The 360 degree view is phenomenal and we have never seen the stars at night time like this before. It is unbelievably quiet, also during day you do not hear anything! The facilities are very nice, the food is delicious and the people are very sympathetic, flexible and keen to provide you with the best service possible. We felt like they have a very good feeling for how the different kind of guests would like to be treated. They are well educated and they speak english, french and, of course, arabic, fluently. Macha Allah…",5.0
We left Chez Taloute this morning after a wonderful one night stay. We arrived yesterday by bicycle dusty and sweaty. We were given a warm welcome by Soufian who was out at the road junction waiting for us. The food was lovely as was the setting. Fantastic 360 degree views.,5.0
"It is really difficult to understand why it is so pricey! The food is so-so, rooms: nothing special, just normal ""berber"" decor; the location is poor, oasis is in the distance. Moreover, you should check your bill carefully, the owner is dishonest, trying to make an extra dirham on everything. For example, we order one dinner (12 euros without drinks!), the owner put 2 into the bill. Do not buy water/food supplies there, they will charge you a lot!",2.0

"We stayed a night on our way to the dunes from Marrakech.  Talout is probably what you're looking for in Morocco.  Great kasbah architecture overlooking a giant palm oasis.  We experienced warm hospitality and good food (nothing extraordinary, but a good tagine and above average Moroccan breakfast).  Rooms are spread between two buildings: the original house, which has the best oasis views and lots of charm, and the new building, which has a swimming pool.  Both are good choices.  Your hosts can draw you a map of a great 2 hour walk through the oasis to the historic Skoura Kasbah.  Well worth the time.  My only hesitation in recommending the place is cost.  For a family of 5, we paid 125 euros for room and half board, which is a fair amount of money in Morocco.  That said, I…",4.0
"We stayed in the new building and the first thing we noticed was a lingering bad smell in the room that turned out to be sewer gas.   The hosts are young men that do not seem to be very well trained in hotel manners but I must say the gentleman that greeted us the first night was nice enough. The second night however was a different story. The issue is with the ""over-friendliness"" of both of the hosts there.  After a harrowing drive to the canyon and back at dark we just wanted a relaxing dinner.  Instead of getting our dinner, our new host sat down at the table for 40 minutes and proceeded to pontificate about his feeling about guests that he hated (especially Italians for some reason) and I was feeling very uncomfortable.  No alcohol is allowed so we'd had to sneek a bottle of…",2.0
"While this place was a little hard to find, it was worth the effort.  Situated on a hill over looking the oasis, there were spectacular views from the terrace.  The room was clean, comfortable, and had probably our best shower in Morocco.  Dinner was spectacular and the staff was extremely hospitable.  There was also a beautiful pool that I am sure is put to good use during the warmer months.",5.0
"This home/hotel was a great find, and a very nice end to a long day after Dades Gorge and a night in Goulmima. The family run home is well appointed, cozy and charming rooms, great bath rooms and HOT showers. The pool is lovely and the outdoor patio and terrace, there really is nothing to improve on, its simply a relaxing and stunning setting for a nights rest.",5.0
"The hotel is located on the edge of Skoura palmerie with stunning views from the roof terrace across the palmerie to the Atlas mountains beyond.  We stayed in a suite for 4 people for one night.  The rooms are basic but nice, decorated authentically and our room had its own private terrace looking out over the desert to the mountains.  The food, which was included in the price we paid, was simple but very good (excellent lemon chicken tagine) and breakfast is served on the roof terrace.  There is a good sized pool.  For the price, we felt the hotel represented very good value and the staff speak very good English, are incredibly friendly and couldn't have been more accommodating.",4.0
"Three nights in Chez Talout with our great host Soufian and we were full of energy again for our last travelling week. The service is very high, friendly and comfortable. The served dishes are really tasty and  the extra bonus beside of the beautiful rooms and terras is the swimmingpool. Definately a great place for relaxing and as a starting point for the palm garden & dades valley.  Anna Floor & Paul",5.0
"While the Chez Talout is a bit of a hidden gem, the emphasis is rightly on the hidden.  It is a few miles off the paved road in Skoura.  But worth the effort to find.  We arrived quite late and found Abdula waiting in the darkness at one of the forks in the road to ensure or correct navigation.   The setting is quite sublime in the desert with great views and delightful place to take in the night sky.  We asked Sofiane to turn out the pool lights and sat back and let our eyes drink in more stars than they had ever seen before in the wide open night horizon and the desert darkness.  We stayed in the newer building.  The room was nice but a few finishing touches were missing i.e. bedside lamp and the toilet seat was  not bolted to the bowl.  Breakfast was good and staff was…",4.0
"Have just returned from a 2 night stay at the new Chez talout as part of a 2 week trip around central Morocco. Absolutely loved the location - the best view from a swimming pool one could wish for .  Very very peaceful.  However, we paid the same for b&b at Chez Talout as we had been paying for half board at other hotels of a similar quality, and the evening meal they served was pretty ordinary.  We ate in Skoura the second night at a fraction of the cost. The rooms were fine, although ours was missing basics such as bedside lamps and somewhere to hang a towel. It doesn't appear to be completely finished. It is a lovely place, but I'm not convinced it's great value for money.",4.0
"Chez Talout is a wonderful find! They have built a brand new hotel down the road from the old one. This we did not know at the time as we'd booked before the new one opened. So imagine our surprise when we turned up to this amazing, perfect destination having expected something a little older and less luxurious!   We cannot fault Chez Talout - beautiful clean swimming pool, lovely patio area around the pool, comfortable rooms with hot showers, tasty lunches and dinners.   Situated right on the edge of the Palmerie, Chez Talout is a great base for exploring the palmerie - the hosts organised bike hire for us (although one bike without brakes!) which is highly recommended for meandering through the trees and kasbahs.   Really enjoyed how quiet it was (early October) and we…",5.0

Highly recommended.",5.0
"Arrived and views over Palmerai fantastic, beware though the hotel is a 10 min drive down a dirt track but we managed it in our small hire car. Stayed here for 3 nights and the room was okay, although fairly dark but food was fantstic every night.  Price was also very good.  The owner was very friendly although we speak almost no Fenech and they speak no English at all so it did cause some difficulties.",3.0
"This was the third time I came to Fint. For the third time I stayed once again at Auberge de la roche noire. I wasn’t disappointed. The people are really welcoming and you feel like home. They share their life with you and always make sure you are all right. During the day you are regularly offered tea, they have a great flexibility for meals and by the way their food is delicious ! If you want to go on an excursion, you juste have to ask and they do everything for you. That time I went on a trip to Chegaga and spent two days in the desert . Everything was perfect I could even practice sandboard and walk on a camel in the dunes .. don’t hesitate to stay at the auberge de la roche noire, you won’t regret it ! It is a little paradise.",5.0

Everyone was incredibly friendly and welcoming, the views and local sights are AMAZING -- I climbed up the hill/mountain nearby to watch the sunset and the following morning travelled down to the Oasis to watch the sunrise.. truly magical. The food was great, too - I fell in love with the berbere chingje' served at breakfast. This is truly a unique experience and if you have the opportunity I encourage you to take it!",5.0

And the most amazing starry sky.  We came here for one night but felt so comfortable, we did stay an extra night.  The facilities are good, the shower was lovely and warm. The hosts are very friendly and welcoming and you can tell that the guests are a priority here.  The food is simple but very good. Delicious freshly baked bread and rolls are served at breakfast.

We were brought to this amazing family restaurant by a guide showing us around Oasis Fint. We were given mint tea on arrival and the host was lovely.

The children were taught to play the drums and nothing was too much trouble. To round it all off they got a ride back to the car on the family donkey  Definitely worth the journey down the gravel track. We will be back for a longer stay without doubt,5.0
We found this place via TripAdvisor for a night stay on our way to Marrakesh. The way into the Oasis is on an unpaved off road and kinda hard to get into but the hosts go out of their way to come far up to accompany the guests. In fact he even drove us out of the valley to the main road when we left the next morning. Since we arrived late on evening we had dinner with them (and what awesome food it was!!) followed by a night of music and dancing. I am certain the night sky would be full of stars but as we had come from the desert already we just wanted to crash into bed.

We were welcomed warmly by Kemal and his family, and enjoyed at dinner some of the the most delicious food I've eaten in Morocco.  The rooms are comfortable, clean, and quiet. And, in the morning, some of the best coffee, made from freshly ground coffee beans in a proper coffee machine. Bliss!",5.0
"A warm welcome for lunch - we took the menu of the day which was excellent! Delicious and not over facing, portions just right. We shared a chicken tagine and a vegetable tagine. Potato cake desserts were lovely - a cross between a pikelet and a rice pudding!  It’s a great stop over after the mountains and heading to the desert. Service excellent. Bathroom facilities excellent!",5.0
"When you're driving through rural Morocco it can be hard to find clean, but still authentic accommodation. But at Dar Isselday you'll get both, as well as excellent hospitality and all the amenities you could ask for. The hosts welcome their guests with open arms and do everything to make the stay enjoyable. Not only is the accommodation comfortable, but it is in a picturesque setting. There is nothing like sitting in the Dar Isselday garden under a trestle dripping with vines and enjoying one of their special fruit-blend smoothies!",5.0

"We stayed a couple of nights in February as part of a short visit to the area. We wanted to get out of town and experience the countryside and get close to the mountains. There is stunning scenery all around and super views from their terrace, the whole place is spotlessly clean, comfortable and with traditional decor. The room was simple but comfortable. You can order breakfast, lunch, dinner, we had dinner there which was nice and a reasonable price, didn't try breakfast or lunch but breakfast looked good. There is a nice walk up to an old Kasbah, and also down to the river, other than that there is not a lot to do in the village  but the owner will take you for excursions at a reasonable price. If you have a car there is plenty to see and do in the area.  Everyone was really friendly and helpful, we would definitely stay there again if we were in the area.…",5.0
"We stayed for one night on route back to Marrakech. The staff were so friendly and welcoming! They even gave polished stones as gifts to the children.   The room was very spacious, which was fortunate as we were using it as a place to repack before flying home.   We spent a lovely afternoon drinking tea in the main courtyard in the last of the day’s sunshine, followed by a tasty dinner.   My only criticism is that the hot water kept cutting in and out which made it tricky to wash the children. ",5.0
"The dar was exceptional! The food was very good, the double room was nice, clean and comfortable with nice hot shower. The location and terrace was also lovely - a great spot to hang out in the evening. What however made the place special to us was the staff. They were all very nice, professional and very helpful. They even organized a hiking excursion for us with the owner as a guide. It was one of the highlights of our trip and so worth it! We would definitely recommend this place and would go back next time we are in Morocco!",5.0

The Room was amazingly treated, decorated at detail emsembling the marrocan art and handcraft. We felt completely in peace and in togetherness, easygoing and spectacular conversations in this family atmosphere. The team is amazing and all take so good care of us!  The food was always delicious and the service with total care and smile. Eating breakfast on the garden with such a montain and valley views! Dar Isselday is a paradise for relaxing in peace and explore around in group, couple or alone. There are plenty of wonderfull excursions and possibilities to hike on the montains and learn, discovering minerals and cristals. Everything single part is recommended, especially the dedication and the work that is done! Big hug for all…",5.0
"We felt very lucky to find this small hotel after attempting to cross the Atlas Mountains by car in October and finding that the road had been washed out during a rainstorm.

The owner was friendly and very helpful and spoke English.  We felt like a guest in his home.",4.0
"You would hardly notice the entrance to Dar Isselday and, if you did, you may not be tempted to stop.

We can never forget the day with them. Ahmed guided us to collect the natural crystals and showed us the daily life of local residences. Though we don't share a same language, we communicated quite well somehow.   The hotel is located on the foot of a mountain on top of which you can find an old Kasbah. It has a beautiful yard and dining room where you can enjoy a rejoicing meal. The guest rooms are cosy and comfortable.",5.0

Dar Isselday is run by a warm family who truly go out of their way to make your stay comfortable and welcome. Everything was fantastic - the room, the views, and especially the food. The dinner we had was better than any other meal we had in Morocco by far - even better than places where we dished out 8 times the $. The breakfast was also so fresh and delicious with homemade jams and breads. It was so good we decided to stay for lunch as well. All the ingredients were locally sourced. I would even recommend going here just for the food if you are in the Ouzazarte area.   We also took a guided tour of an abandoned Kasbah…",5.0

Our group were transiting from Marrakech to Uazaza and stopped at this gorgeous restaurant for lunch. Clean and welcoming with a terrace with a wonderful view. We had a salad and vegetable starter with their freshly made bread which was delicious. Then the best lemon chicken tagine of the trip. Moist and flavoursome. Dessert was called  Batata which was garnished with preserved lemon and cinnamon and was like a custard tart. Mint tea to finish. Very friendly staff.,5.0
"Dar Isselday was wonderful, and Kamal and his family treated us very well. We stopped off here on the way back to Marrakech from Merzouga in the Sahara as our minibus passed through Tisseldei (most companies take this route.) The food was the best Moroccan food we have had and Kamal was exceptionally kind and considerate. The rooms were large and had air con and good showers. We would wholeheartedly recommend this place and rest assured it is easy to access (just ask your company if they can drop you off there and to organise for another minibus following  the same route to pick you up the next day to go back to Marrakech.)",5.0

Beginning to end this was an amazing experience. Hospitality is second to none. Kamal and his family welcomed us warmly. Very clean rooms and grounds. The guesthouse is set on a small hill over looking a valley. Check in and check out were easy. The food was the best meal we had since our week in Morocco. Great 1-2 hour hike behind the guesthouse to an old ‘house’ filled the afternoon with an activity. The village is small but a perfect place to spend a night outside the busy hustle of any major town. ,5.0

It is a true pleasure to stop at his comfortable home, admire the view of the Atlas Mountains and get back our strength for the long drive that awaits us.",5.0
"We were returning to Marrakech from Zagora and decided to spend a night here to break up our trip.  Kamal gave us a very warm welcome and prepared dinner for us that night. 80Dh for a 3 course meal was very good value. We enjoyed the warm salad as well as the tagine, unfortunately the dessert was a bit too sweet for us.   We really enjoyed our stay however we did not have hot water for the shower and therefore could not shower that morning!

There is something very peaceful about this accommodation.  Food is consistently good and breakfasts can be served on sunny terraces surrounded by vegetation and views. Kamal can also guide you on a walk to the valley and the river, and you can scout for rocks and minerals in this walk. He also sells mineral and fossil specimens and I bought a few from him.  We were travelling from Marrakech to Skoura and decided to stay overnight here. Next morning, we went to Telouet from here and then onto Skoura.  .",5.0

During our stay we were able to explore the surrounding Atlas region, and the Glaoui Kasbah at Telouet, an hours drive away. The area is beautiful and Dar Isselday is well located for this purpose. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend it other travellers too. Thank you Kamal.",5.0

The home itself is beautiful: a gorgeous traditional house overlooking a magnificent valley. The terrace where we had breakfast is a garden, an orchard, and a patio all at once...

We went on a day trip with Kamal to look for minerals, crystals and amethyst which our children absolutely loved.  You could easily stay for a couple of nights here rather than just one if your a family or without kids.  A great place to end our trip in Morocco.",5.0

The signpost is a little late in along the road as it is right outside the place but its not immediately obvious which building it is, so you are likey to drive straight past before you've realised you have passed it. There is parking directly opposite though we managed to get our bikes up the path and into the courtyard. The ensuite rooms are brilliant as was the communal areas and the food.

We had a small tour offered on arrival, which was a nice surprise. Since the first night almost nobody was there, we could choose the room we wanted. The food is among the best if not the best we had in Morocco. Rooms are clean and quiet (at night), and tours and treks in the surroundings and further away are offered.

モロッコをツアーで訪れる方が多いと聞くのですが、レンタカーを借りて自分で運転し、宿を見つけて滞在し、現地の植物や鉱物に触れ、お料理を教わり、村の人と（観光客としてでなく）普通に交流する旅行も最高です。 この宿には、マラケッシュからのアトラス山脈越えに思ったより時間がかかり、また、きれいな景色に寄り道をしすぎてしまって、あたりが暗くなってから到着。昼間に電話をして夕食をお願いしておいたのですが、宿がみつかり、ミントティーを頂き、タジン鍋が出てきたときには、昔の旅行者はオアシスに着いて、こういう落ち着いた気持ちになっていたのかなあと想像しました。 朝起きてテラスに出ると裏山の景色の壮大さに感激。下に見える村々の人の生活の様子も教わりました。 次回もぜひ泊まりたい宿です。お勧めします。 A great place to stay if you are looking for a genuine Moroccan experience. I would highly recommend considering staying if you are in the area or passing by.,5.0

A sensible drive out of Marrakech this is a great stopping off point and one of the highlights of our trip.  There was a warm welcome and tea on the terrace in this delightful spot.

We stayed at Dar Isselday for one night back in October 2013 on our return to Marrakesh from the desert and the Todra and Dades Gorges. The guesthouse was easily found as it is directly located at the one main street through the mountains and this village. We were immediately greeted by the owner of this guesthouse and shown our room which we had reserved beforehand through one of the big hotel reservation websites. The room had a comfortable double-bed and a nice and spacious bathroom including shower. The house and all the rooms are built in the traditional Berber style and were very clean and inviting.

The first day he took us on a tour of the local surroundings and his family's gardens and orchards and we ended the day with an amazing meal made by his sister-in-law Najat.  The food we had at Dar Isselday was by far the best on our whole trip in Morocco.

We quickly received our keys and rooms, which are located in individual houses, nicely furnished. They all boost a mosquito net, which is a great touch and not always found in Morocco.  After some refreshing beers by the pool, we all took our showers and headed for dinner, which was sublime. Everything freshly cooked and the menu includes a mix of French and local cuisine, all served with a smile.  Breakfast is equally good. Home made jams, apricot juice and other delicacies.

"Location This hotel is on its own, not near anything. Getting to the hotel requires quite a bit of off-road driving, however there road signs along the way to guide you.  Stay Stay is average. My room is dark as the lights are mostly not working properly. There no Wifi in room as well.  They do provide their handmade soap and rose water for guest.  Food Food is really delicious. They made their own food using the garden. I think the dinner per person is about €20 or less.  However, breakfast is quite pathetic.   Conclusion Generally the experience with the owners are pleasant except for the room conditions where lights are not working.  This hotel might be more suitable for family with kids and who wishes to stay for long.  ",4.0

"What a pity we couldn’t stay longer! Although the route to reach the hotel might seem a bit bumpy and long (but well indicated), it all pays out when you arrive at the hotel. The staff is so friendly, yet polite and efficient. The premises are amazing, the rooms are around a fantastic well-kept garden and a swimming pool.  Everything at Sawadi seems to be made with great care and love. We felt as part of a family.  The room was fantastic, spacious and clean. In our bathroom we could use the aloe vera soup they produce, amazing!   Breakfast and dinner were both delicious, many of the products they use in the kitchen are home produced (marmalades, olive oil, etc). ",5.0
What a beautfiul pearl in the dessert of Morocco. To get it out of the way: the only downside is that the road to Sawadi sometimes is quite hard to drive.  But what you get once you're there is amazing. From the staff (which are all locals) and the way that they prepare their food (locally sourced or grown on their own lot) to the rooms and facilities. Would've stayed longer if possible.,5.0
"We stayed here for three nights in total, two on the way out and one on the way back travelling between Marrakech and Merzouga. It's a lovely, laid back place with great staff, comfortable rooms and beautiful grounds. Food was great too. Yes, the wi-fi is a bit iffy at times but I have no problem with that - it meant the kids had to communicate with their mouths for a change! We also had an issue with lack of hot water in the morning, but possibly due to the poor weather and lack of sun on that day.   It's a shame that Catherine and Phillipe's ecological ethos isn't taken on by many of the other hotels in the area but at least by are staying here you can be confident of minimising your impact on the local environment. We hope to return for a longer stay one day.",5.0
"We stayed here last night. The room was clean. Otherwise there is no hot water. In both the evening and morning we had to either take a cold shower or no shower. There was no toilet seat, only the open toilet bowl. (See picture). The room is dark and needs updating. They state free Wi-Fi but it is only available in restaurant or lobby.  The grounds are overgrown and not well maintained. The pool was covered with a solar blanket. That might have been their hot water source. I can not recommend this hotel. ",1.0
"Sawadi is the place to be if you want to relax and escape the city. You can relax at the ecolodge or hike and explore the area around. The food is great, the rooms are comfortable and stylish.  You can spend the afternoon between the pool and the spa. Far from the mess of the city and civilization, this is the right place to disconnect and relax. I recommend the walk in the palm grove and the massages after the Hammam. On top of it, you will be welcomed and spoiled by great people: Kader and Said. They will help you with everything and they will make you feel like home. (Attention, they like to make jokes!)

Our driver, Cherife, was very knowledgeable and spoke excellent English. He gave us a wonderful tour of the gorge and surrounding areas.   ",5.0
"I was glad we had a 4 X 4 to reach this gem off the beaten track. It is well into the valley and the winding unpaved road tried our concentration. But once we arrived it was all worth it. It is like an Eden with a beautiful pool and lush grounds. There are large rooms with terraces on their roofs. The main house is very large with a great kitchen. And the fact that they had a bar meant we could have wine with dinner, which isn't so in many Moroccan Riads. The staff is very friendly and very French. The wifi is a bit iffy. All in all a good bed. A good sleep. Very quiet. A hot shower. The food was fresh. They have an organic farm which we did not have time to visit unfortunately. We were only there for one night.",5.0

We took a guide to bike in the palmeraie all the way to a kasbah and had a great time with Said, our guide, and he was fantastic. There is a farm next to the hotel where the owners produce all their vegetables, fruits an even olive oil, rose water and calendula oil, all of which you will try during your stay.

The rooms and the food are excellent, the natural swimming-pool and adjoining rest areas idyllic and the whole experience extremely authentic.   If you are looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of cities like Marrakech, Sawadi is the place to be! The best way to get there is by taxi or car hire...a 30 minute drive from Ourzazate airport of a four hour drive from Marrakech or Agadir.",5.0

You were so kind to prepare her a meal which was sooooo tasteful that she forgot how tired she was. There was also a kind man who kindly introduced our daughter to a donkey.

You can either read and relax or be active and horse back ride or bike or just walk.  You can also go to the local market and get a beautiful hand made rug or just enjoy a moment away from the craziness of a city life!,5.0
"If you want to know where paradise is then look no further than Sawadi.  Set in several acres of organic farm land, a few kilometres from the town of Skoura,  Philippe and Catherine have created the quietest, most peaceful place possible.   This was the first week of our hooneymoon and after the hustle and bustle of getting married we needed somehwere peaceful to reflect and recharge our batteries. Sawadi was so quiet and friendly, no cars or bikes just the rather pleasant farm animal noises from donkeys and cows that they have on this organic farm.  There was a roof top terrace to admire the distant Atlas mountains, a swimming pool, table tennis and a number of other activities available and the food was fabulous - with most being provided from the farm itself. Somehow Philippe…",5.0
"I cant even strat to describe Sawadi.  In the middle of the Skoura palm oasis, Catherine and Philip have done an amazing job in making their property and amazing oasis of friendly service, outstanding care for the environment and a superb operation respecting the customs and the essence of the region.  We were on our way to Marrakech from the desert and needed one night in between.  We got in before sunset and regretted not being able to book more days.  The accommodation is very good with lots of details everywhere from Rose products in the bathroom (it is by the valley of the roses) to information on the property to all things needed for a good night sleep.  On the food side, they make sure that as many items as possible come from their organic farm.  We had a beautiful…",5.0
"My family and I loved our 3 days in this clam oasis. French owners take a personal interest in their guests, and have instilled the same ethos in all the staff. the bungalows are beautifully appointed and the gardens, with views onto the Atlas, a treat. We had planned to go on excursions, but ended up just chilling by the pool..... Beautiful food too. It was an authentic experience - and because of the overall charm and care, the low pressure in the shower or the occasional wait for accompanying vegetables to a main dish, did not matter. I was also heartened to hear that the staff get proper work contracts and pay (not necessarily the case), and I think this is evident in the sense of ownership the staff demonstrate. Thank you Catherine and Philippe, and Jane, from Naturally…",5.0
We're so glad we did the detour to the sawadi in skoura. this was the most beautiful place we stayed and a crowning finish to our marocco travels. Beatiful bungalows. authentic food. huge gardens. And a located perfectly for a stroll in the palm gardens.,5.0
"A beautiful hotel, the rooms were magnificent and the attention to detail superb, the toiletries provided were a real treat. The staff made us feel at home and were warm and friendly, we got a tour of the grounds, the garden and animals soon after we arrived. One of our party became ill and the manager Said got up to check she was OK at 2am. The river flooded while we were there, a truck was provided by the hotel to transport guests across the river and to the nearest town.",5.0
"During our one week vacation in Morocco, me and my boyfriend made a little trip to Ouarzazate, and we stayed at Sawadi for 2 days. The place is absolutely stunning and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to visit this part of the country! We received a warm welcome from the staff upon arrival, the rooms are beautifully decorated and very clean, the swimming pool and garden a true delight, and the food is just gorgeous: almost everything is homemade and organic and simply delicious, from breakfast to the 3-course dinner (traditional Moroccan couscous and tajines). During the day, you can chill around the pool or make a day-trip around the palmerie, visit kashbahs or go further into one of the valleys (we did the first two and I can recommend this).

"The sometimes testing journey from Skoura to Sawadi seems a small price for the tranquil ambience, the starlit night sky and the relaxed friendliness of the staff as well as the other positive aspects of a stay at this hotel, and the excursions that are available. We were treated with kindness and warmth the whole time by the staff members. It is a memorable and very worthwhile place to stay.  This is an ideal place to relax and offers a very tranquil alternative to the larger cities in Morroco.",5.0
"Sawadi was a wonderful haven of tranquility after the hustle and bustle of the city. The garden is gorgeous, the food exceptionally delicious, night sky spectacular, and the rooms really attractive. Staff were friendly. A lovely fire at night to keep us warm at dinner was much appreciated!

Much recommended, this tastefully nature-integrated resort.",5.0

"This riad is quite difficult to find, and for us, even more difficult to find our way out of. It is also out of the main city. Unfortunately it was farther out of the way than we expected and getting lost trying to leave, we lost a lot of time. But this is the only remotely negative thing I would have to say and for some people, the remoteness might be a plus.   The riad itself is gorgeous Berber style, with a pool, lovely terrace area for meals, a small hammam. The room is a decent size with a fantastic bathroom, good hot water, and soap, lotion for use. Our room is a triple.   The hammam we made use of, a small steam area where we are scrubbed down by a staff member. I must say it feels fantastic.   Meals are tasty and they do serve a variety of wines and beer. Even though we…",4.0
"Sawadi is a one-of-a-kind place to stay while traveling around Morocco.  It is an oasis within the famous oasis of Skoura.  The air is fresh, the pool is refreshing, and the food is grown right there on the grounds of Sawadi.  Philippe and Catherine were attentive to all our needs during our 2 day stay.  We rode bikes through the palm grove's maze of winding roads in search of the famous kasbah that decorates the 50 dirham note.  The historical site was interesting, but the journey through the palm grove was one of the highlights of our stay.",5.0
"We only stayed one night on our passage from the gorges and on the way South to the desert. Despite our very short stay, Sawadi was one of the nicest places we slept in while exploring Morocco. Unfortunately, we were on a very tight schedule, but Sawadi really got us thinking on whether we should stay a bit longer. We decided to move on, but at the end of the trip, looking back, we both agreed we should have stayed one more night.  The place is absolutely gorgeous and the concept behind, as well as all the work being done there is admirable.

"We stayed at Sawadi in mid-April on our way to the desert and then again on our way back. My only regret is that we didn't stay longer. Sawadi is not just a truly wonderful stop, but a destination in itself. I wish I had stayed a full week exploring the region, lounging by the beautiful pool, eating excellent and healthy meals prepared mostly with organic food grown and raised on the property, and enjoying the hamman and massages.  We have two small children and they loved Sawadi.

"Sawadi is a lovely spot in a palmerie in the middle of Morocco, and makes a good stop going to and from Fes and Marrakech, the desert, etc. It is relaxed and serves lovely food, most of which is grown or raised on the premises. But if that weren't enough, you will not find a nicer, more friendly staff anywhere. Catherine and Phillipe, who own and run Sawadi, treat each guest as if he/she was the most important. Ditto their hard-working staff. And if that weren't enough, the people at Sawadi can also arrange trips and transportation to and from other places too. Do take the time to go to the desert in the south - it is quite an experience.",5.0
"We're not hardcore ecotourists but we do like to at least give a nod to the idea that we shouldn't create undue burdens on the people and environment we encounter as we travel. That's the least we can do as we profit from wonderful adventures in places like Morocco. But it's extremely difficult to find hoteliers committed to these principles in northern Africa. Yes, many hoteliers will encourage guests to reuse their bath towels in order to conserve water. Going beyond that, however, is a rarity.  So when Sawadi was suggested to us we were intrigued -- enough to work in an overnight visit that, in hindsight, I wish we could have extended.  Typically, social and ecological responsibility requires sacrifice. And it does here to the limited extent that you'll find that things may…",5.0
"Catherine and Phillippe are a most charming couple.  They’ve created an almost unique guesthouse according to ecological principles for the preservation of the earth and the saving of water and energy.  A lot of the food served is organically produced on the land and on the farm and the meals are delicious.  The local staff are very charming reflecting the happiness and relaxation that the place emanates.  If you want to spend a carefree time in a place with a heart and a soul and want to reduce you footprint whilst holidaying, you will be very happy and inspired with your stay at Sawadi.",5.0
My wife and I recently spent two nights at Sawadi.  The hospitality provided by Catherine and Philippe was exceptional.  We traveled from Agdz to Skoura and arrived in the late afternoon well after lunch time.  When we asked about lunch Philippe said no problem.  Lunch was fantastic as we had a large salads with fresh organic ingredients from the garden. We also enjoyed the grilled sardine dish.  While at Sawadi we enjoyed  two dinners that were really great.  They also have a very nice wine selection.  The food provided a very nice break from all the Tagines we had eaten over the previous two weeks.  Our room was beautiful and very comfortable.  A walk around the nine hectare farm is a must.

The owners are very patient and helpful with whatever question you have and give you good advice how to plan day trips for example to the Dades gorges, the Rose valley or nearby villages.

A working farm, it does not skimp on the smaller luxuries (such as high count sheets) and is not at all as ""rustic"" as one sometimes find in eco-tourism, no doubt because of the attentions of the hosts and the staff who treat you like family.

We will definitely go back to the Southern part of Morocco and Sawadi will without any doubt be one of our stops.",4.0
"The service was warm and welcoming and the the farm to table food was beyond amazing. Everything was so fresh and gourmet. WE really appreciated Catherine and Philippe and found them to be charming hosts. Although there was plenty to see in the surrounding area, we didn't want to leave the farm, and instead spent our days reading on the porch and wandering through the farm.  It was the perfect place for us to recharge our batteries after our Sahara adventures.  When we left for Marrakech, we ended up forgetting the address of our riad there and we were totally lost, but Catherine saved the day, when we called her in Skoura and did some research  to help us out so we could find our place.",5.0

"Despite the flowery language Lonely Planet uses to describe this place, I have to agree that it really is ""an oasis within an oasis.""  The farm is a fresh break from the desert monotony and I'm a sucker for farm-to-table fare.  Upon our arrival, Philipe built us a fire in the common room and Catherine served us mint tea.

Catherine and Philippe the french hosts and their moroccan staff are attentive and also discrete in a very familiar way.

The staff are all attentive and really friendly, nothing is too much trouble and they made a great effort to chat despite my minimal grasp of French.  The food was perfect for us, everything…",5.0
"This was a beautiful and peaceful place to stay. The staff were extremely kind and friendly, the rooms were comfortable (and had heaters which were needed in the night time in Feb) The food was delicious and reasonably priced.

"As other reviewers have highlighted, Sawadi is located right in the heart of the palmerai and perfectly situated to experience the peace and solitude of this stunning location. The complex is a large walled property and truly an oasis within the oasis, with individual dwellings spread throughout the property and a number of communal areas, including a rooftop deck, enticing pool, facilities for table tennis and badminton and even a small onsite farm.  This is one of those very rare properties where every detail is absolutely perfect and the owners have gone above and beyond to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. We couldn't possibly think of anything that could have been improved. We were very sad that we only stayed a single night and could have happily stayed for several…",5.0
"We have just returned to Canada/Argentina from Morocco and without a doubt, our stay at Sawadi was the highlight! It was incredibly peaceful, the food was marvelous and the hosts (and their amazing staff) were very helpful and kind. They made us feel like part of their family. They operate in a fully  sustainable fashion and are highly integrated into the local community, including a donation of 30 bicycles to help local girls attend school. Catherine also toured us through their organic farm, which was very enjoyable.  We stayed in a suite room with a fire place that we used each evening. It was very nice.",5.0
"Sawadi is located very far into the oasis. You have to drive for 7 or 8 km on a windy dirt road in order to get to the hotel. If you are trying to find the place at night, it may take a while. The staff is definitely welcoming but mostly to people who want to spend a few days there. If you are only spending one night, they will not invest as much in telling you about the place. Our room was clean but had some weird features. For example, the bathroom, while private, was outside of the room and was only separated from the main hallway by a curtain. Definitely not a great feel. The food was very good though. We had some fish tajine and it was delicious. Most of the food is cooked with products from the oasis which is a nice plus. Overall an interesting experience but some weirder…",3.0
"Sawadi is located 7kms from the centre of Skoura so it really is in the heart of the palmerie. The owners Katrin and Phillipe were most welcoming and even picked us up from Ouarzazate. But what we were impressed with most of all was their total dedication to sustainability, growing organic produce and employing and teaching the locals essential skills that they will benefit from throughout their lives. Our room/ very stylish bungalow, was well equipped and had a beautiful fire place (essential for mid winter nights). It felt a little dark but that's the way the Moroccan houses are built in the desert and oases to cope with 50 degree summers. Dinner was like a 'kinder surprise'. You never knew what you would be getting but you always knew it would be delicious. Made from home…",4.0
"After the the turmoil of Djemma el Fna and the majesty of the Tchika Pass and the never ending beaten earth vistas of Kasbah GlaouÏ Terouet and Aït Benadou, we took refuge amongst the palm trees and gardens of Catherine and Philippe's Sawadi hideaway. Our bungalow was delightfully designed and appointed; spacious and warm with a charming fireplace. Dinner and breakfast were both delicious, with nice touches to the menus (vegetable soup from a bewildering selection of greens, fresh pomegranate juice). Genuine hosts in a charming and comfortable setting; a memorable stay. Merci à Catherine et Philippe",5.0
"We visited Morocco in late Nov - Dec and had an amazing journey through this magical country. Our 3 nigh stay at Sawadi was definately a major highlight. Each bungalow is made with traditional moroccan designs and located in a peaceful corner of the Palmerie. We spend the first day walking around the palmerie and observing the locals harvesting olives and dates. On the second day we hired bikes and went into town, visitied the famous Kasbah/museum and cycled back past mosques and crumbling kasbah's to Sawadi.   Sawadi itself offers everything you may ever want. Places to lounge around, large open fire (which we savoured during the cool nights). Roof top terrace overlooking the palm/olive grove and the most delicious meals. The staff were amazingly helpful and were always on hand…",5.0
"Sawadi is a beautiful place to stay. All bungalows are embedded in fruit and vegetable plantations which makes them perfectly quiet and surrounded by birds and plants.

"Situated within the palmerie at Skoura, Sawadi is a haven and a good place to relax a while and enjoy the peace and quiet. The garden grounds are well tended with many trees, flowers, vegetables and vines mingling alondside the pathways which lead to the guest rooms. We enjoyed walking in the surrounding lanes with palm and olive trees and ruined kasbahs.   Our room was well presented, clean and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.There are several lounge areas to relax in - all very comfy too.

"We unfortunately first stayed 'next door' at Kasbah Ait Abou because it was inexpensive. When I became ill however after eating the simple tajine dinner there (in a freezing tent outside... they have no indoor dining area), we decided to move down the road another 200m to welcoming Sawadi. We're so happy we did!!! It is a small stretch of the budget for us (we spent $130 in total but it included a gorgeous double bungalow, tea, and a first class dinner and breakfast) but it was absolutely worth the money (especially in comparison to next door.) The hands-on, friendly french owners are passionate about their resort, organic farm and orchard, and about bringing environmental practices to the area. They don't have it easy in Morocco. But, their passion has paid off and the grounds…",5.0

It's a bit of an adventure to find Sawadi but the moment you arrive you will feel the warm and friendly nature of the place.

All the staff are quite delightful yet leave you to feel at home and get on with your own thing.  And the food is extremely good, with fresh produce from the garden.

"First impressions are important, turning up at the place, the car park and main entrance looks like a building site, which given the impressive photos on the website was very disappointing. The place has potential to be very beautiful given its location in the palm grove and interesting kasbah type buildings, but the outdated decor and extensive use of wrought iron furnature makes the place look dilapidated and tired, it was also pretty messy when we turned up. The rooms are big, the bed was very very hard, and there was too many colours on the wall to count. Dingy energy saving type lighting inside the room added to the already glum feel of the place. To add to the list of things, the water hot water did not work, Im assuming this was just a bit of bad luck and they were good…",2.0

"Just spent 2 nights in Sawadi, where we enjoyed wonderful hospitality from Philippe and Catherine in the middle of the Skoura oasis.  Amazing setting, beautiful pool and so restful after long drive from Agadir and 5 hours back to Marrakech through the Atlas.  More time needed to explore or do a desert safari as out of the way.  Beautifully laid out and good food : we loved the berber omelettes!  Highly recommended  experience by our family (with 2 adult daughters) ",5.0

At the end of the night there was live traditional music and because of the birthday of one of the guests, the chef made a special birthdaycake.

I am a birdwatcher and clocked three new species in the garden, plus several which we had only rarely seen before.  In the town of Skoura, we were the only Europeans and were only hassled by one gentleman, so that was quite fun, but the public realm is not maintained to European standards (ie there is rubbish, dust and dirt everywhere!).  Great drive to Dades gorges - v spectacular - about 2 hrs each way, and might have tried a bit more but we should have hired a 4x4 rather than our Opel Corsa!",5.0
my boyfriend and i stayed in sawadi for 4 nights in August. it was a such a refreshing place to relax before going back into the hustle of the Moroccan cities. the food was the best we had in Morocco and made from the produce of their organic farm - absolutely delicious. the pool was a god send in the heat of the summer! all the staff were lovely and helpful. our room was beautiful and fairly spacious.  we went on a trip into the dessert organised by Sawadi which was an amazing experience and the guide was very friendly. we were taken right into the dessert and stayed in a little encampment. the scenery to and from the dessert is also wonderful  we were very tempted to cancel the rest of our trip and just stay at Sawadi but we were in Morocco to travel so pulled ourselves away.,5.0

Sawadi is about 7 km from the town of Skoura and it's a drive best done in the daylight to avoid taking the wrong turn. The route is well marked however. We would highly recommend a visit. The hotel is surrounded by extensive grounds and a huge organic garden, which is full of bird life. There are several separate small houses. We were lucky enough to have a room in the only two level unit, with a terrace that afforded great views. All the buildings are traditionally designed and great care has gone into the furnishings.

The hotel is 7 km on a dirt road from town, the road condition is actually pretty good, so it's not too bad driving in and out when you've figured out where you are going!   Once we found it, it felt like we had stepped into an absolute oasis (and didn't want to leave)! The grounds were just beautiful, and the common dinning areas were very stylish! The breakfast and dinner were delicious, and the atmosphere was very romatic! We loved it and would definitely recommend this to our friends!",5.0

Quiet and tranquil, just a 'dirt road' leading to this little sanctuary on the edge of the palmerai.  Really not hard to find if you follow the directions and arrive in daylight.  All the staff are warm and welcoming and well trained.  And there's a fair bit of English spoken, if you are shy of using your 'Franglaise'.  But dont be!  Catherine and Phillipe are adorable, helpful hosts who make every effort to welcome you.  Great food and wine.

Several bungalows, all built in kasbah architectural style, are spread over a huge organic garden full of veggies, flowers and herbs. Rooms are tastefully furnished in traditional style of the region and provide all amenities you need after your days driving from kasbah to kasbah.

Meals were first class, and largely made from local produce, and the area surrounding the elegant and comfortable accommodation is all given over to growing food in a sustainable way.

Great suites, beautiful grounds, very friendly staff and very good food- all at a very reasonable price. They even had a fully-stocked bar and hammocks. Charming wildlife: a persistent cat, frogs who came at night to hang out by the pool, etc. It really is a great place and I'd recommend to anyone: I could imagine it being a great place to throw a party.

The sign seemed to indicate that you go along the river rather than cross it but that's wrong.  On the other side, we had to stop and ask locals to find the way.  Once there, there's little to do.  Since LP mentions birds, we hoped to do some birding but no one there seemed to know anything about birds (the one staff member who was supposed to, advised us to just stand still and watch).  We were more ignored than ""spoiled silly.""  The food, however, was great and they have a well-stocked library.  It did seem quite pricey tho.  I suppose I would…",4.0
"Excellent service , wonderful location and food. A good place to unwind, situated in a farm but with great facilities.",5.0
"Catherine and Phillippe are wonderful hosts who have created an architectural wonder.  They are supported by really great, friendly staff.  The evening meals were fantastic with home grown produce.  Their selection of excellent Moroccan wines is a must try. We only had two nights here but would recommend a stay of at least four nights.  Forget the car and enjoy walking through the local groves of date palms to kasbah ruins.  Use Sawadi as a base to visit the Todras and Dades gorges, or the Vallee du Draa and desert, or just chill round the swimming pool.",5.0
"Philippe and his staff are very welcoming and friendly and went out of their way to help us get to Sawadi (rain meant that the river could not be crossed in a car, Philippe had to send a 4WD - although even without the rain I would be hesitant to cross myself - it was quite a wide river!). Note that Philippe's English is limited so knowledge of French will go a long way at Sawadi.  Meals were really great and the whole location was amazing - so many fruit trees. entertainment and a large pool. Really enjoyed my stay and would recommend a visit.",4.0
"Stayed at Sawadi for 2 nights with my wife and young son. We wished that we had made it for longer as it is a great place. Not only is it a Riad but also a small farm with animals, crops and orchard. Almost everything about the place is excellent with great rooms, fantastic food and very friendly and helpful staff.    Hosts Philippe and Catherine were very good to deal with. At our request they were able to organise for us an excursion with guide to the Dades Gorge and Valley of Roses.   There is also a really good swimming pool which is just perfect after a long day out sight seeing.",5.0
"Staying at Sawadi is a unique experience. Combining a proximity to nature with wonderful comfort and hospitality, it offered us a memorable escape from the heat and dust into a lush oasis. The accommodation in separate cabins is secluded and private. There is lots to do on the farm itself and around and about. The food is absolutely delicious and produced almost entirely on the farm.",4.0
"Sawadi Riad is an oasis of relaxation, tranquility, and unique pleasures. A place to learn about the people and their history. Located en route between the desert and Atlas mountains, Sawadi is deep inside the palmiere of Skoura, connected to the local community  and culture.   Sawadi has 17 beautifully decorated rooms – 3 in the riad and 14 in small buildings spread throughout the property. Four cultivated hectares of an organic working farm provide jobs for local people and food for the riad's creative restaurant that offers a fusion of Moroccan and French styles. Here you can relax, swim, learn to appreciate the local culture, take trips to nearby sites, or revitalize yourself for the next leg of the journey.",5.0
"We stayed here on a trip from Marrakech to the Sahara at Merzouga and found it to be a welcome break in our journey. The food was excellent, there was a most relaxing ambiance and the non-chlorinated swimming pool provided the best fresh water swim I've had for many a year. It's not easy to find but well worth the effort.",5.0
"This place was by far the best we staid in in Morrocco, and the irony is that it was probably better Value for Money than any other place! The rooms were lovely, the hotel so friendly that you felt ""at home"", which is something you need when travelling in the outback of Morrocco, and some of the most delicious food I have had, whether in Europe or Morrocco. They have really managed to mix the Western and Morroccan styles well.  And to top it off, the fact that almost everything is from the hotel itself (chicken, cheese, fruits, vegetables etc.) makes it even more magical!",5.0
"Getting there is a bit of a challenge since it is 7 KM out of town and the signs arent always that clear. But its all worth the drive through the old town and over the dirt road since it is a very nice and relaxing place. The owner and staff are very helpfull and the pool and garden are just beautifull. And for a change, the food is very good!! The rooms are in little adobe houses and are very clean, decorative and spacious. The hotel is in the old town and invites for a walk",5.0
"Althought  the 7 km way is quiete difficult to ride....is was the most beautiful location we have ever seen. An oasis with palmtrees, nice rooms in the kasbah, delicious food. We stayed here four nights,  just relaxing  beside the pool or walking around in the garden. For those who are looking for ""animation"", this is certainly the wrong place!  Some things to see for a day or half day trip: The valley of the roses,  Sidi Flah, the souks in Skoura on monday. But than you need a car, you can arrange this in the hotel. But don't forget to stand up in the middle of the night to see more than a million stars.....",5.0
"If you want to leave it all behind and be far away from everything, there is no better place. 7km off the road through the oasis - just the way to Sawadi is an adventure in itself. On the way you'll be able to study the rural life in a ""palmerie"". Once inside, it is total peacefulness. LOTS of room for everyone to spread out across the enormous property which is technically an organic/sustainable development farm. 95% of all meal ingredients are from the farm and all meals were exceptionally good. Also, outstanding value.",5.0
"Correct place, quiet, lowkey, very good food - thankfully as once you're there you wont easily be going out for dinner anywhere, as its 7kms into the oasis on an unpaved, rocky road. Not the easiest to find, too - make sure you know your way with the hotel beforehand or phoning on arrival. The pool is good, and the place may be a particularly fortunate choice for families with kids as it seems to offer several options for the little ones. Also an option to consider as a resting point after some days in the rough.",3.0

"I stayed at Sawadi with my boyfriend for 4 nights. We hired a car in Marrakesh and drove all the way. It's at least a four 1/2 hour drive because you wind through the mountains. After reading some other reviews I would say that you can definately get to Sawadi using a normal car. It's a rocky road (basically a 7K dirt track) but you don't need a four wheel drive, infact Philippe and Catherine (the owners) haven't got one themselves. The other thing I would say is if you can, don't attempt to find Sawadi in the dark! We did and despite clear instructions, got totally lost. However the locals are very friendly and will point you in the right direction - infact a guy on a motorbike took us right to Sawadi's front door for a well deserved tip.   Once there Sawadi is a very relaxing…",5.0
3rd visit for us.  Remarkable attention to detail in all aspects of the guest experience. Great fun & very safe environment for young children.,5.0
"My friend and I stayed here for 2 nights recently.  After previously basic accommodation, Sawadi was a welcome respite, comfortable and beautifully furnished.  Surroundings quiet and idyllic in this extensive oasis.  Large garden supplying produce for the table.  Accommodation in beautiful buildings like mini kasbahs around the garden.  Lovely pool.  Backdrop snow-capped mountains.  Simple but delicious food.  The owner, M Philippe, charming and helpful, even to the point of driving us to our picnic site to look for our lost car key!",5.0
"We arrived very late at Kasbah Sawadi, but received a very warm welcome by staff and owner, who served the most delicious and original tagine, made entirely from home grown produce. The hotel is superbly located in a 'palmerie' oasis, offering magnificent views of the snow-capped Atlas mountains. The buildings housing the rooms and restaurant are of simple beauty, reflecting years of careful planning by the owners to achieve a feeling of tranquillity, authenticity and respect for local architecture and traditions. The hotel provides for all facilities and luxury to 'earn' a relaxing vacation, for adults and children alike. Wished we had stayed a couple days more!  Highly recommend to all!",5.0

"This a fantastic place to stay - very relaxing with amazing food.  The accommodation is great, especially considering its location.  The real highlight though is the wonderful French inspired Moroccan cuisine made with incredibly fresh produce straight out of the hotel's gardens.  This is seasonal cooking at its best.  The only possible downside - good luck finding it...",5.0
"Arriving at Sawadi from Marrakech was everything the website promised  - it really is a beautiful place. We were welcomed by Abdul who was charming and showed us to our room which was really lovely - and looked better than on the website - the sustainable building techniques used really work here.  The staff at Sawadi are really great, very friendly and helpful and the place itself is beautiful.  I went horseriding in the area which is a great way to see it and the local instructor/stable owner Abrahim is really excellent.  Overall a great stay - breakfasts were uninspiring, would have been great to have been offered orange juice or eggs as the pancakes weren't to my taste. There's something rather 'clunky' about the way Sawadi is run but this adds to its charm! and i love their…",4.0
"We stayed here for one night on our way from Marrakech to Erg Chebbi desert. As soon as you get off the main road a part of the adventure allready begins by driving through the green palmeria with old kasbahs and houses. We did it with a small car (Fiat Punto) which was OK. Wouldn't reccomend it when it's dark, though :) The place itself is very relaxing, you're in a little paradise. Especially with kids, because the can run around in the gardens, plunge into the pool and go and see the animals at the end of the terrain. Breakfast was nice with all kinds of jams and warm pancakes.",4.0
"After a 120kms walk in the southern desert, arriving at Sawadi looks like a miracle. More then a hotel Sawadi is a taste of real marocan life style with friendly french owners, Catherine and Philippe. Their guest house is located in a farm wich provides their succulent ""cuisine"" with fresh ingredients. Sawadi is the perfect choice while visiting the Ouarzazate region including the Skoura oasis, the rose and almonds valley, the desert and the people. Our biking day in the Skoura oasis just out of Sawadi guest house allowed us to discover the architecture, the people and many surprising things.  Thanks a lot to Catherine and Philippe for their smile, time, interesting discussions and their knowledge of the region. Catherine, Youssef was very nice ! His carpets are wonderfull and…",5.0
"Already the adventurous way from Skoura to the farm Sawadi is a fascinating experience that leads you through a riverbed into a wonderful oasis full of date palmes (no need for a 4x4). After a hearty welcome by Philippe, the owner, we got our charming little house. The whole place is clean and everything is arranged perfectly. Staff is very friendly. A visit in the hammam is a must. We enjoyed the food, where most ingredients were grown at the farm. A visit at Sawadi is a """"must""  when travelling the ""Street of the 1000 Kasbahs"". ENJOY !",5.0
"To get there, you follow green arrows which will take you to a beautifull place just outside skoura. You'll have to cross a river (no bridge) but you don't need a 4x4 car. When they open their gate you suddenly appear to be in paradise. A green lush garden with beautifull 1 stock houses spreaded over their premises. The garden is well taken care off and you hear great birdsongs. They grow there own food, have animals, play-grounds and a great swimming-pool with no chemicals in it. The french owners speak english and are willing to cook a good meal. Sorry we only booked for 2 nights. The rooms are spacious, very well equiped and this was the first bathroom with a great shower since 2 weeks. It was very quit when we were there. They told us many french people have found there way…",5.0
"Frankly, first impressions weren't great. After an adventurous drive from Skoura town across the dried up river bed and down little lanes (follow the white arrows) we finally arrived at Sawadi. The Moroccan member of staff was friendly and charming on arrival but the owner Philippe seemed to have little record of our booking. We had booked a suite, a double room and a twin for our family but the allocation seemed random. We were shown a series of rooms, none of which matched our booking. However from then on things looked up. Vegetarian meals which had been booked arrived. Although there was no choice, the food was generally very good. We enjoyed relaxing in the berber tent by the pool. Two of us hired bikes to explore the palmerie - and returned with a puncture! Philippe made…",4.0
"It's great, but only if you can find it!   I tried to get there in good time, but a three hour delay setting of meant we arrived at Skoura just before dark. By the time we got there it was pooring with rain, the light was dimming and we had no map. The rains had stopped Philippe's (the owner) phone from working, so we spent several hours trying in vain to find the place. A local lad eventualy jumped in our car and directed us. Make sure you take their map (www.sawadi.ma/trajet_light_uk.pdf) and get their during daylight. Philippe is totally laid back, but very affable and a real gentleman. His English is better than my French (which is diabolical), so we thought it very kind that he made such efforts to chat to us and give us a tour of the farm and palmerie. When the wadi…",5.0
"We've stayed with our children (7 and 4)  for 4 days in Sawadi and enjoyed it very much.  We were going to visit the palmeraie and Ouarzazate and the kasbahs in the region, however, instead we stayed all day in Sawadi..!  Great pool, beautiful rooms, very good and fresh meals, beautiful surroundings; our children loved it and so did we. Drinking wine in the garden at sunset while the French owners and their staff were preparing our meals made me feel like a queen ;-)  I can certainly recommend this place to anyone looking for a bit of quiet and beauty after buzzing Marrakech.

We came here with our two kids 7 and 4 years old. It is a fantastic experience just arriving over dirt tracks and then crossing a dry river bed to get to this tranquil oasis. Very chilled out place. We lazed by the pool while our children played ping pong or sat in the hammocks (even in March although the pool was cold). They visited the farm and vegetable beds in the Kasbah where you get to eat the vegetables for dinner. Set menu in the evenings was fine and great soups that we loved as a first course and then tajines of chicken or lamb with good Morrocan wines.  We stayed five days which was perfect to chill out and see a bit of the area after bustling Marrakech. Don't expect a slick city hotel but do expect a lovely experience driven by a French couple with an eye on the…,5.0
"We loved this rural, laid back, relaxing and authentically Moroccan farm in the wonderful Skoura palmeraie. The French couple who owns it and their staff were extremely friendly, courteous and  attentive; they  were most helpful in organanizing day trips, watching over the kids, giving us directions and even sharing recepes of the delicious food at  their restaurant; they went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and help us overcome our own language limitations - very basic French and no Arabic. The rooms where we stayed were recently renovated,  charmingly decorated in the Berber style, airy and comfortable; we enjoyed the lovely pool, the orchard. The bicycle outings to the palmeraie were great and a day treck to the Valley of the Roses and the Dades gorge was superb.…",4.0
This place is terrible! The owner's did not bother to get up to great us or to show in any way that they would have been anything else than just guests. We had driven 7 hours from Marrakech and were expecting the same nice service as usual (Maroccan tea etc. for welcoming). Then they did not seem to know anything about our booking. Also they did not have a clue about which rooms we should take or where we should take our luggage to. The French couple who runs the place seem like they do not have any experiece in running a place like this.

After the terrible welcoming we though that we could have a nice relaxing hammam. It was booked for the same evening. After…,1.0

If you want to visit anything in particular you need to point this out.  The French owner, Philippe, is very nice even if he does come across as a bit disorganised. He is very friendly and has a good rapport with his staff.

"Our first impression of this place from it's creaking internet site with uninspiring pictures was one of 'it's the best of a dull bunch'. However, once we entered the beautiful gate we saw something very much worth the long and expansive drive from Marrakesh. It's true that the original rooms are small and dark, but the newer extensions towards the back of the farm are modern, atmospheric and breezy.  We loved it so much it was a drag to leave the place for a day's sight -seeing. The pool was a great luxury after a hard and hot days exploration.

The welcome we got here from Najib and Philippe and all of the staff was second to none. We were made to feel very special indeed. It's a great place for children, there's loads to see, like the valley of the roses and the dades gorge, we had a couple of very special excursions with Najib which we will never forget. We were originally booked in here for just one night on the way down to Merzouga but we liked it so much we stayed for 5 nights and rearranged our entire holiday.

Staying with the children, we felt very relaxed and in excellent hands.

Frogs dip their toes in the pool by night, the food at Sawadis restaurant is a treat, the accommodation lovely and true to the areas Berber influences and the team of staff are a delight - nothing is too much trouble.

"Perfect location. Great staff. Cheap. Great coffee - said by an Italian... Wonderful guide working for them, yiuseph:with  him and another very funny guy I went on a one day trip to the valley of roses, AMAZING, a real MUST in life_said by someone who is very hard to please! It was 800 Dirham about 75 euros for us both,  lunch included . It was a private tour, maybe it s cheaper for a tour booked with agencies, but I had the best time,  did not laugh that hard for ages. There is also a one day tour to Valle of dra, which is supposed to be as beautiful,  but a huge rain prevented me from doing it. Ah well.  Next time I will do it, stopping in zagora to keep going to M'hamid, apparently the real desert, non touristy - merzouga, the tourist desert, is amazing anyway. Do not book…",5.0
"We spent just one night in the hotel, and it was alright but nothing more. The people working there were very sweet and helpful though, so I would recommend it if you are passing by and need a place to stay for one night.",3.0
"We spent two nights in this hotel because we wanted to continue from Ouarzazate to the desert. The place is an average hotel, not expennsive but also not very clean. The breakfast is typical Moroccian style and the staff is helpful and friendly. The good thing is that the location of the hotel is very convenient. It is very close to the souq and markets.",3.0
"Great option for ouarzazate. We stayed here three nights as stopovers for trips. Great location a short distance from the market plaza, many car rentals and restaurants. Across the plaza, on the Main road, some well-prized, good quality stores for ceramic, lamps, carpets et c Rabat and the one selling wooden doors outside. Great small patisserie up the road from hertz. Wifi works quite well in the rooms and is even faster in lounge. Ask for rooms with a balcony! Breakfast is plentiful, and includes fresh juice. Staff was very friendly and helpful - thanks for a great stay.",4.0

"Well located near souk and shopping street.  Comfy bed, good hot shower, and window and small balcony provided lots of fresh air.  Close to mosque so can hear call to prayer.  Nice place!  Didn't get to try bkfst as had early bus.  Only concern:  in early morning front door locked from inside and had to rouse guy w key--dangerous if there was a fire or earthquake or other emergency.",4.0
"This is a good option in ouarzazate for a stop when you are heading to the desert. Don't expect too much of atmosphere, just a basic clean room for a good price; double 250dh. Furthermore, there is wifi and parking in front of the hotel. And is right in the centre. ",4.0
"On an unexpected visit to Ouarzazete recently, a friend suggested I stay at another friends’ hotel.  I did a quick check on the internet for Hotel Amlal and found the reviews to be rather unfavourable but decided to make up my own mind.  Yes, the hotel is a little dated, the decor also. The bedrooms and attached bathrooms basic; but really everything is quite adequate if you are looking for somewhere cheap and reasonably central to the local shops, eateries, even a couple of bars/clubs.  My visit was in June so the temperatures hovered around the 40 degrees but the rooms have air-conditioning so there was no problem sleeping. The mosque is one street away, but I did not hear any of the prayer calls.  I also had plenty of hot water, not that I required it at this time of the…",3.0
"Hotel Amlal  This is a faded, poorly run hotel.  The rooms are not very comfortable, and the mattresses on the beds are old.  Booking.com stated that the rooms have air conditioning and a television, but they have neither.  We were there for three nights and no one ever came into the room to make up the bed, empty the wastebasket, or change the towels.  We even had to ask for toilet paper.  Even though, for the first night, we were the only guests, we had an email from Booking.com stating that the hotel had notified them that we were a “No show”, and would be charging us for the first night.   Definitely would not recommend this hotel.",2.0
"Frommers describes Hotel Amlal well.  The rooms are old and basic but the customer service could very well make it to be an overall pleasurable stay.  Hot water is spotty, breakfast is good, aircon/heater works, and there's parking!  Make sure to look at your room before agreeing, and as always in Morocco, double confirm everything.",3.0
"Want five star facilities? Go and pay five star prices. On the other hand, if you want a good value budget hotel this is it. £28 got us a clean double room with ensuite shower and a tasty evening meal and breakfast. Admittedly the decor could do with a touch up but it was  comfortable. Friendly staff and parking outside the door.",4.0
"Amlal is a clean nice budget hotel, they also serve a nice breakfast and an incredibly good dinner. recommended !!",4.0
"Hotel Amlal in Ouarzazate is clean and cheap. They offer all kind of rooms (2, 3, 4 beds) and the employés very kind and speaking different languages - even a few words Dutch!",4.0
"We stayed 1 night passing through Ouarzazate.  It's definitely no-frills, but for 25 EUR a night was clean and had air con.  Shower was rubbish but warm.  You can park outside and it's about 5 mins walk to the main square, though more like 20 mins walk to the kasbah which is on the other side of town.",3.0
"I stayed two nights at Hotel Amlal, in february 2010. I liked this hotel and I recommend it. The room was spacious, although basic, but wh had a mini TV, AC, private bathroom. A good deal for what we paied (300 dh per day for a triple room). The hotel has a restaurant with resonable prices.       We took an excursion to  Ait Benhaddou. Ishu guided us through the village, we made few stops on the way to Ait Benhaddou and admired the scenary. After we visited the village we had to cross the river in order to go back to car, but Ishu was not attentive and he made an unexpected bath :)",4.0
"We visitited Ourzazate as a stop in trip (alone not with any kind of agency) form Marakesh to Erg Chagga desert and stayed in Hotel Amlal. The hotel was easy to book from our home country by email and the reservation was valid despite we came to the town quite late (around 20:00).  Hotel is located in the ""City Center"" (Ourzazate is a rather small town with one or two main streets - but it is very vast you have to go about 3km from city center to bus/taxi station) one one of the main streets, but it is like ""in the back"" so it's not loud inside. It is very clean and the staff is very nice (for the first time in Marocco I met a woman - working at the reception - who is such open to people, not afraid like others). The bathrooms are in ""maroceean"" standard but they are also clean…",4.0
"A lovely family who is going to look well after you! The food is good, the wifi works great, the room is lovely and clean, you get towels, there is a hairdryer and aircondition (which we didn't need at all). The water in the shower might need some time to get warm and it's not a strong flow, but as you get a really good price, those things are to be expected. The next day, we could even go  to Ouarzazate with the owner who himself needed to do some things in the city.  Thanks so much Abdellatif and family, shukran bzaf bzaf!",5.0
We stayed here for 1 night and it was so relaxing. Abdellatif is such a nice and welcoming person. We would recommend this kasbah. Food is very good. Room is small but with all amenities. Enjoy your stay !,4.0
"Kindness, hospitality, welcoming and friendly staff. All of that is The best things that happened to me.   And discovering that place is wonderful  Thank you so much Mr Abdellatif for sharing informations and lot of other things  .😁😁😁",5.0

"Abdellatif welcomes you to a beautiful kasbah in traditional style. He recommended us a helpful and honest guide to explore Skoura and the souk (on Monday). Their tajine, couscous and fromage de chievre are delicious. We had tea on the roof with a magnificent view on the city and the Atlas mountain range.",5.0
"Hotel is very cozy, traditional family home converted to little hotel. Food was delicious, and hotel interior great. Only issue I had was upon payment I was requested to pay additional money ( for tax ), that was not mentioned upon arrival. ( in Morocco price communicated is always total, and this was only experience I had in 2 weeks of travelling around to pay extra. ",4.0
" A perfect welcoming and stay. We feel safe, comfortable and very well looked after in a traditional manner. A natural sense of hospitality with an amazing ""cuisine"". The Kashba offers a great circulation and open plan roof-terasse. More than charming: Just Perfect!",5.0
We've spent two great nights and days at this nice hostel. Abdellatif is a very helpful and warm host who does everything to make his guests feel comfortable. The food was delicious and the rooms clean and cozy. Also mentionable is the substantial breakfast which leaves nothing to be desired and the rooftop terrace with a great view over the oasis.,4.0
"We spent 15 days at kasbah Datte d'Or. It´s a long time and we can definitely say: Abdellatif is a great host. Most of the time we were on the rooftop terrace to work in a quiet atmosphere (and in the sun;-) ) with our Laptop, but in between we did some tours with Abdellatif, like Gorges des Dades, Vallee des Roses and also a camel trip through the desert and it was so, so good! He showed us places where we never would have stopped by our own. Usually we rent a car for traveling around, but this time we had no car. In the end it was a perfect decision, because for our purpose to work from morocco it was just not necessary and for the rest we could totally trust Abdellatif. He showed us the good spots and it didn´t felt touristic. The food at his home is good and more than you can eat. After two weeks we felt like part of the family. Abdellatif and Naima have such lovely girls. To make it short: We are so glad to have been there! It was an authentic experience. Abdellatif is honest and always tries to make his guests happy. We had our privacy, but still the contact to the family. He did much more for us, than he had to. We were invited for lunch with his friends and much much more. The hospitality was an example that we can learn from. For all those, that cannot speak french like us: it´s totally fine. Just use your hands and feets or google translate. We were always able to communicate and sometimes just laughed about wrong translations.   We can highly recommend it!…",5.0
I fully recommend this hotel. Rooms are clean and spacious with bathroom. The owner is very friendly and helpful and offers trips around. Dinner and breakfast were delicious! Nice view from the terrace to Skoura.,5.0

We spent a couple of nights at this Hotel which we discovered by chance. the owner Abdellatif is welcoming and will be able to show you around the area. We were also happy to meet his nice family and were invited to share a couscous meal with them! recommended..,4.0

"Amazing little Kazbah in the middle of Skoura. Great views from the rooftop where you can have your meals if you wish.  The rooms are very homely, not plush but lovely traditional decoration, comfortable bed, clean bathroom and hot piping water from the shower. There was air con in the room and despite it being quite cold and windy outside we felt very cosy.   The owners speak Arabic and French and have very little English but we managed to get by with the odd words we knew and the usual gestures and smiles! The food was amazing. Definitely the best Tagine I had throughout the whole trip.   Unfortunately we only stayed for one night and didn't have time to take advantage of spending more time in the immediate area. It looks like a really good place to explore if you like a bit…",5.0
"the kasbah is situated in skoura and is very nice. For me the plus was really the room itself which was really well decorateed. The food was good, especially the cheese. We did a visit of the palmeraie with Abdellatif which was great, and turned out to be an incredible photoshoot, I think abdellatif would like to be a photographer and clearly enjoyed taking lots of photos of us and we are very happy to have plenty of photos of photos of teh two of us in this incredible location.",4.0
"Considering the low price, the rooms are ok, even if the bathroom can be euphemistically considered ""essential"". Cuisine is the best possible in Morocco, everything you eat feels very ""handmade"" and ""homemade"" (we had probably the best Tajine of all our Moroccan trip). Abdellatif is very very helpful, we needed a hand with a punctured tire and he helped us, taking us to a friend who changed it, checked and inflated all our tires for only 20 Dirham (less than 2 euros). For that price around Skoura is the best you can get.",5.0
"Having travelled from Merzouga, Skoura was a natural half way stop before going on to explore Ait Benhaddou on our way back to Agadir. We arrived at the Kasbah La Datte D'or in the evening and were welcomed with a delicious three course meal which we ate in traditional Morrocan style. The rooms were clean and comfortable with plenty of hot water. We were made welcome by Abdellatif and his family who talked to us about sights to see in the local area. In the morning we ate a lovely omelette breakfast in the garden which was followed by fresh dates and delicious fresh orange juice. One of the greatest pleasures of our stay was spending time with Abdellatif delightful baby daughter. I would recommend Kasbah La Datte D'or  which was excellent value for money",4.0
"Auberge Kasbah la Datte d'Or is situated in Skoura, a small town some 50km from Ouarzazate which has much to recommend it. There are many interesting Kasbahs in the area. Whilst we did not actually stay in the Auberge (it was a lunch stop on a long drive that day), we found plenty to recommend and would return for a stay. The lunch was excellent, food of great quality and served by an attentive and chatty host (communication in our basic French). He is also an experienced guide for the region. The dining room was tastefully decorated as was all the interior, in Kasbah style (adobe walls and high ceilings). Compared to the scorching heat outside it was relatively cool, relaxing calm inside. We had a look at the rooms in case we would go back and took some photos which we share on…",4.0
"If you like to travel just a little of the beaten track (Ouarzazate) than this is THE place to be! In the lovely town Skoura this Kasbah has much to offer: it’s traditionally built but with all the comfort you can ask for. The rooms are pretty, spaceious and very clean. The roof terrace where breakfast and, candle light, dinner are served has a 360 degrees view over Skoura, a town not effected by tourism yet. This kasbah is run by Abdellatif and his family. Here you’ll find Moroccan hospitality to the max and although we enjoyed all the food during our travels, the breakfast and the 3 course evening meals cooked by Abdellatif’s sister were the most delicious of all!! Abdellatif is also a guide. He, in general, takes people to the well known places of interest but if you ask him,…",5.0
Stopped here with my friend Walid for tea. Fantastic terrace with great views. Very good service and the interiors are beautiful. It’s a little difficult to find but we’ll worth the effort. Next time I’m in Quarzazate I’m definitely coming back here.,5.0
"A beautiful building in a great location for looking out over the Ouarzazate valley, the staff are brilliant, welcoming and friendly and we received an unexpected tour of the extraordinary herb garden by the charming proprietor. We ate in the restaurant twice and enjoyed the food on both occasions, the breakfast was much better than average for Morocco and when we had to leave early for our drive back to Marrakech they took the trouble to prepare breakfast for us the night before and leave it all laid out and ready which was gretaly appreciated. We heartily recommend staying here.",5.0
This is a perfect place to stay for a short öre long stay. Very nice People and a Nice house.  We were there for a short stay but if we come back it would be for longer.. The breakfast is complete and more than enough. Thank you for having us…. See you soon,5.0
"This was one of the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at so I would certainly recommend staying in the king room with the biggest bed, windows and private balcony. The views from the rooms overlooking the palm trees, mountains and berber village were mesmerising. Everything was clean and felt luxurious for a great price. This place is absolutely ideal for a romantic or family 2-3 night stay away from the hectic streets of Marrakech and if you are visiting Ouarzazate/Ait Benhaddou. Although it feels like it is in the middle of nowhere, it is easy to reach by car via Ait Ben Haddou and the taxis to Ouarzazate cost 15 euros (150 MAD).  One of the best things about this stay was the staff who were beyond kind and accommodating to any requests. They were a spectacular team who kept the place clean, calm and positive - we will never forget them and the best mint tea we had all holiday! The dinners were super affordable (€15/150 MAD) for a delicious 3 course meal and I highly recommend the chicken with msemmen and the sorted vegetable appetizer. The inclusive breakfasts in the sun are very memorable and filling! It is certainly worth visiting for a well deserved retreat - thank you Riad Chay!…",5.0
"As with most others who reviewed, we stayed en route between Sahara and Marrakech. The riad is quaint with a very friendly and attentive staff. They were very helpful and not pushy. We enjoyed the rest and the surroundings of the palm trees surrounding the property. If you are looking for a nice stop between destinations, give this place a try!",5.0
"Highly recommend this Riad, great location to the studios and Aït Benhaddou is just 25mins down the road. Fantastic views from the roof top terrace and really friendly staff, we really enjoyed our stay here. The rooms were a great size and comfy. We have the King Room with the balcony which was a nice way to finish the day, relaxing in the sun with the birds. Dinner and breakfast was wonderful and very tasty to.",5.0
We spent one night at Chay Riad and we really enjoyed it! They welcomed us with tea and fresh pomegranate juice and they made us feel really good since the first minute. The room was just perfect! We took a bedroom with a private balcony and the views over the river were just amazing! We decided to have dinner at the Riad and the food was really nice! We hugely recommend Chay Riad!   Elena,5.0
We got a corner unit with a balcony. Watched the sunrise from the balcony and it was a lovely view. The rooftop was a nice place to chill. There’s no lift in this place so carrying luggages may be a pain. They served egg tagine for breakfast which Id say my favourite breakfast in Morocco. There was water included in the room.,5.0

Able to attend to our very specific dietary requirements (eg no moroccan spices)  - Extremely friendly staff: willing to chit chat and share their knowledge with you, and also able to give you privacy when needed  - GOOD FOOD!

"We didn’t expect at all to find such a beautiful place in the trip to Sahara desert! Right when we got enter the front door of Riad Chay we were feeling so happy and relax with the beautiful view and the garden inside.  The Riad is very clean and the decorations are just lovely! Traditional and give a strong sense of history.  People work here are very nice too and super helpful!  Also they have so delicious food!  One thing we love a lot is to sit on their terrasse taking the traditional moroccain tea, and watching the Atlas mountain with snow on top and and the big palm trees around and listening to the birds.. Everything is just perfect!  We enjoyed a lot in this place and thanks a lot for this great experience!  P.S: this place is well known by their roses, and now it is…",5.0

I had a good time and long discussions with Younes and his team, thank you guys, and next time I am definitely staying in Riad Chay",5.0
We really had a great time at this place. The rooms have a stunning view and the service is great. Since it is possible to have breakfast and dinner for a reasonable price we also had the chance to enjoy the morrocon cuisine. They really try to make your stay as memorable as possible. Everything is very personal and clean. Ahmed the owner speaks good english and tries to help wherever he can. We really enjoyed our stay and didn't expect such a positve experience at all. If I ever go back to Morocco I would definitely book this B&B again :),5.0

"The staff were lovely & very helpful, Manilla in particular she was wonderful. Menu limited to one dish though but it was a lovely chicken tagine. The surroundings and entrance  are stunning. The shower in our room was also excellent. Let down unfortunately by the location, opposite a couple of schools which can make it noisy, and not near anything, set back from the centre. Also the bed in room 9 was so hard it was honestly like sleeping on the floor. I woke at 4am and couldn't get comfortable to sleep again. It was a long drive back to Marakesh the next day for us & my back was hurting badly. Some great points here but shadowed by lack of sleep and a pained next day.",3.0
"A very beautiful building, tiled throughout in ancient Moroccan style.    The building is tall and thin, so there are a lot of stairs - with a private open patio at the top.   Good welcome, and delicious breakfast in a comfy and luxurious 'salon'.     Attractive pool as part of the building.    It was the hottest time, and for the 4 of us, the air conditioning could be a little more powerful.  A week later we tried to book a return visit, but it is clearly very popular, and was fully booked.",4.0
"This riad is conveniently located close to the airport, but a litlle far from the downtown area where are most restaurants. Unfortunalely, it is also probably very close to a mosque: around 6 AM, you almost feel the morning prayer's loudspeaker is in your room! On a positive note, the staff is courteous and efficient. Our room was clean and well-appointed and decorated with nice morrocan features.",3.0

"Good location for the airport, not far from the centre, and in a nice clean location with some shops and little cafes where you could get coffee and pastries. This is by far the best place we stayed in Ouarzazate, the staff provided free transfers to and from the airport, but if you don’t have that, you can do the airport trip for just 5 euro in a taxi. Staff were polite and catered to all our needs, rooms were clean and equipped everything worked as it should. We would stay again.",5.0
amazing staff - went out of there way for us we visited 3 times in 1 month. we will return and we recommend this place for everyone the front of house gentleman was very friendly.. the breakfast was basic and did the job.,5.0
Nice little Riad.  The staff was very friendly and the food was pretty good as well.  The only thing I will say is that if you are on foot then it is a little far removed from the down town.  It is probably about a 1 mile walk to the main square.  The rooftop has some nice views over the town. I would recommend this place.,5.0
"Stayed here with my wife for 2 nights visiting ouarzazette the ambiance was great it was quiet and not on the main road but tucked away on a side street I felt welcomed straight away when the gentleman who runs the front of house offered us tea and biscuits and let us view our room,  we chose to eat twice there and the food was also amazing he cooked us what we requested one night tajine the second couscous and both came with starters and deserts for 120dh  each which was an acceptable price to pay.  I asked the front of house manager if he could arrange some dates from around the ouarzazette region within 2 hours he got me a box which came from zagora he also assisted me with where to go on daytimes and what to see which was also great.  I do not have one negative thing to  say…",5.0

It is very clean & the food in their restaurant are delicious. It is very clean place & so relaxing.  It is not far from the main town centre. ",5.0
"The riad is relatively new, close to the airport, so not in the center. It took the owner 10 years to built it, piece by piece, yet it doesn't ""feel"" new. The rooms were just ok, I did not love it, but the main area, the doors, and stones are very beautiful. service was simply great. friendly, accommodating staff. It is a great place for an overnight if you need to be close to the airport. We ended up not taking the flight, as Royal Air Maroc overbooked the flight, and we were pretty much stuck. But then, Chamoda, from the riad, helped us tremendously: Picking us up from the airport--after we checked out,  back to the riad--and arranging a driver for us going to Fes, all of which done with genuine care.  So overall, I feel very lucky we stayed there.",5.0
"Was a delight to stay here. Sorry we only had one night as the rooms were lovely, the food excellent and staff just lovely & really helpful. I would love to go back as our stay here was memorable. The decor was modern but traditional and very tasteful.",5.0
"Located in a residential area, away from the city centre provided a very quiet secure environment. The entrance was absolutely stunning, beautiful tiling, ornate wooden doors, carpets, embroidered cushions, delightful. Our room was large, plenty of hot water and pressure however one flooded the bathroom floor when showering. Large window, so we didn't use the air conditioner. The food was very nice, a three course set meal each night, breakfast was impressive, really liked how local ceramics were used and the condiments all served in small tagines. Dealt all the time with one staff member, he was very helpful organised a taxi to Zagora and a plug for Ipad.",4.0
"The rooms was large and well appointed, very comfortable with large double bed.  We even had a large balcony overlooking the street.  The decor was a delight to behold - most unusual.  The staff were wonderful and so willing to help in any way they could.  We enjoyed our stay immensely.  Great breakfasts - sort of continental with a Moroccan twist. The downside was the location - you need to have a car - we found it difficult to navigate our way back after dark.",5.0
"This riad is simply excellent. The design is wonderful, the hotel is clean, the staff is very nice and helpful and the breakfast is what you would expect from a morroccan breakfast  - a lot of good food. Ouarzazate itself is a pretty town - clean strets, brick-colored buildings and friendly people on the edge of the desert.",5.0
"Very nice, clean accommodation. Traditional Moroccan style rooms, beautifully maintained, impressive place to stay. When the hotel called to ask if they could help us find the accommodation it was a relief after driving around Ouarzazate for 30 min as we forgot the address, Hamouda came to meet us, big thank you!  Food was good too......hope to see you again next time.  Jane and Philippe",5.0
"I have been to Ouarzazate many times, this is the first time in the Riad Ourzazate. I am so happy. great rooms, flat screen tv, brand new, spotless, wonderful food, among the best tagine I've have in Morocco and with 53 trips under my belt here, that is saying a lot!  Owner arranged trip into the desert in Mhamid, had a blast on camels and camping in the dunes.  This hotel is in quiet residential neighborhood, only a block from the airport if you have early morning or late arriving flight. Highly recommend for anyone alone or family or small group. Much better than one of the big hotels with poor service and busloads of tourists.",5.0
"This place is a gem.Faultless. we only found it by their sign on the side of the road! Hamouda welcomed us with tea and biscuits and gave us a lot of info about Ouazazarte and the the trip to Tenehir. i cannot rate this place highly enough. The room, dinner and breakfast were great.",4.0

"This riad is in a new residential area of the city - very quiet. The riad itself is beautiful - traditional Moroccan-style using design elements and techniques found in historic residences. The public areas are welcoming and comfortable for relaxing, enjoying mint tea or snuggling up with a book - especially the terrace. The rooms are wonderfully comfortable - large, great beds. lovely linens, good lighting, even closets. Ours had a balcony overlooking the front patio - perfect spot to enjoy something cool. The bathroom was beautifully tiled, large, clean, well appointed with a double sized shower - heavenly!

Fantastic shower! Best so far in Morocco. The guy who looked after us was cool. Friendly and spoke English. Recommended us a couple if nice restaurants and took us there so we knew where we were going and could make an informed choice. The restaurant we chose Kasbah des Sables was stunning. Only ended up here on the off chance as it is not in the Rough Guide book and we went to the Le Petit Riad first but it was full - they recommended this place. No pool but beautiful decor and interior. Offered to make us food if we wanted. Breakfast included and asked us when we wanted it. The only down side was there were bare wires in our room where the tv should be and the roof terrace was nice and authentic Berber with lots of rugs and comfy sofas but no loungers to lie in the sun.

"This is not the place to visit if you expect 5 stars, super fast internet and good heatsystem during vinter. This is, by our oppion - a look into berber life in a good and well placed guesthouse. If you know that you are in the mountains, and therefore everything is runned with nature - this is the place for you.   We had the pleasure staying three nights here. We are from denmark, and have booked an iternerary through MarokkoExperten where Susanne assisted us. We like being active and culturul on vacations and therefore we booked two days of guided hiking.  The owner of the guest house, Ahmed, was our guide for both days. He truly introduced us to berbern life and gave us a unique insieght in the local community.  We got to experience visiting native nomads and farmers deep in the mountains. Had teabreaks and lunch in organic gardens and went to collect minerals and crystals in a vulcanic valley.  The food are all brought here from local farmers - so everything is organic and tastes incredible. We had different food each night, with just small berber twists. There where no ala carte menu, but instead you will have the menu of the day, depending upon the availability of the farming. Irocha try to support the locals. This is not only a place to visit, it is a look into a very peaceful and organic lifestyle.   Thank you for your time and kindness, Ahmed.…",5.0
An interesting different location. Room comfortable. Surrounding facilities all unique and interesting and comfortable. A great place to stop over. However food was disappointing after having read previous reviews.,5.0
"Do not believe the raving reviews — they must be false. Contrary to the description, this accommodation had no hot water whatsoever, and the internet was switched off. If you want to wash in warm water or if you need internet connection, avoid this hotel.  The place is run shambolically — as if it was managed by volunteers have taken over this hotel today and just do not know what to do with it. There seem to be no-one in charge.  We were immensely disappointed and let down by Maison d’Hotes Irocha. After being on the road for six hours to get there and arriving at 17:00 hours, we were told that the room had not been prepared and we had to wait. When we were eventually shown to the room some 40 minutes later, it was disappointing. It was on a lower level and immediately gave the impression of a converted goat or sheep shed — basic, unwelcoming and uncomfortable room.  Communication between the owners or staff was virtually non-existent. Even though we did not ask for dinner it was assumed that we would be eating dinner. There was no choice of meals or choice of time at which the dinner is served. If you want to eat, you will have to eat what they bring to your table, and at the strict time which they dictate. When we sat to have a dinner at the specified time (20:00 hours), there was a tasteless soup without any bread, a meagre tagine, and a nondescript desert. No drinking water was given at any time. At all other Moroccan establishments I was provided with drinking water and plenty of bread — but not here. The following morning, this hotel demanded €30 for this unsatisfactory dinner!  The en-suite bathroom was extremely basic and rather grubby; but I did expect to be able to take a hot shower for the long journey to the airport and following flight. Alas there was no hot water whatsoever in any rooms of the hotel. When I asked other guests they confirmed that there would be no hot water until late afternoon when the solar panels had provided it. This place was the most expensive place we stayed during our trip and was not worth half of the €72 we paid for one night. My recommendation is to avoid this place at all cost.  The private road to the hotel is steep, uneven and badly maintained. Inexperienced drivers would struggle to drive to the hotel and to turn around within a small car park. You will be woken up at 05:00 and then again at 06:00 o’clock by a loud speaker on a local mosque.…",1.0
"We used this accommodation as a stop over between Rose Valley and Imlil.   We occupied the rooms in the courtyard, all the rooms were tastefully decorated and very comfortable. There are indoor and outdoor common areas to hangouts.   The staff is accommodating and managed to organized dinner for us taking into account our dietary requirements in the last minute.   Note - this accommodation is situated on the side of the main road (on a little hill). You can hear some traffic noise in the outdoor area, we had no issues with noise in our room.",4.0
"Ahmed and his staff are amazing hosts. The place is truly something special and probably one of the nicest places I saw in Morocco. The view from the terrace is just stunning. The pool is big and just behind the house you can start hiking.  The food, which is freshly prepared each day, is very very delicious and a lot of the vegetables are grown in their own garden!",5.0

This hotel is absolutely wonderful; some of the best food we've had on our trip and an amazingly beautiful setting.

I wish I could have stayed longer! Thank you for your hospitality!!,5.0
"We spent a night here in March 2019 while en route from Merzouga to Marrakech. This is a charming laid back property nestled high on a hill in Tesseldey. It’s got a lovely view from the terraces down over the village and valley below. While the guest suite itself was rather plain and simple (though perfectly comfortable), the property really shines in its public areas - the terraces are gorgeous and the public lounge and dining spaces are eclecticly decorated with local furnishings. We had a lovely welcome tea and snack in the courtyard beside the pool when we first arrived. The pool looked lovely, but the water was too cold to swim during our visit; instead we hiked up the hillside behind the hotel to the deserted Kasbah at the top, which took about an hour round trip. The dinner and breakfast we were provided as part of our half board stay were tasty and plentiful - we appreciated that dinner was not just another tajine, as we’d had so many of those on our trip leading up to our stay here. We did find it rather difficult to book our stay here as the hotel staff did not reply to our emails and we had to ask the agency we hired our driver from to book our stay for us.…",4.0

A great place to spend the night  on the road from Ouarzazate to Marrakech!",5.0
We thoroughly enjoyed our quick pit stop in Irocha and wished we could have stayed longer. Our room was spacious and tastefully appointed.

"Ive never given a hotel a 1 star before and I feel bad giving this a 1 because they were nice people... but it was a tough experience the whole way through.  The hotel is located at the top of a steep dirt road.  If you have to do it in the dark you may want to make out a will first.  The room wasn't ready when we arrived despite it being fairly late in the evening.  The bed was fine... The bathroom/shower is not exactly a place that I would go in to get clean.  The wifi didn't work at all.  And they don't take credit card.  I didn't have enough cash on me, so had to drive 45 minutes to the nearest ATM before checking out.  I'd like to think this was a one off bad experience, but I have never been so happy to leave a hotel before.",1.0
"I booked a room online and ended up arriving really late at night. Unfortunately, the staff had forgotten that we are checking in that day and had to hunt someone down through the dark grounds. Once we found someone to check us in it took a while because their internet connection was weak. The room was bare bones, but charming. The next stay we did enjoy a very delicious homemade breakfast.   Overall, it's a no frills place within a village setting.",3.0
"We stopped here on our way from Dades to Marrakesh. The place is really nice, has a good view. Not so quiet due to the near road but for sure you can relax here on the fabulous terrace. We didn't use the pool as it appears that the temperature here near the mountains is lower than in the rest of south Morocco. The staff is caring and friendly. The dinner was very tasty, used Moroccan spices but cooked and served in european way. I have to give Irocha 4 stars instead of 5 due to the high prices compared to other places we stayed. Be carefull while booking - the price des not include a breakfast, so we needed to pay additional 5 euro per person for a very small breakfast (coffee, orange juice, two jams, butter, joghurt and bread).

The only 2 drawbacks I saw/experienced were the poor Wifi (only available on patio) and with an impossibly ridiculous password. Very unfriendly and inefficient The 2nd issue was the staff never came to hep us with the luggage when arriving or departing, and  when we arrived, did not inform us of the facilities in the place e.g. we only saw the swimming pool when we were departing. SO removed 2 stars for that.",3.0

The rooms and surroundings are very beautiful and we found the place very relaxing, comfortable and clean. Dinner and breakfast as well was great.

The style is a blend of laid-back southern French with a Moroccan touch. We visited at the end of January (when the nights are cold) and the heating in the room worked well enough that we didn't have to sleep with any extra layers on- we were delighted since we weren't so lucky with our hotel in ouarzazate. They also have hot water- provided you're a little patient and allow it to warm up.

I don't know how many nights I've stayed here in total, but I know it's a lot more than I originally planned. In truth, I'm finding it hard to leave! Ahmed (who grew up in this valley - the ruins of his grandfather's house can be seen across the river) is an absolute delight, knowledgable about all kinds of things and interested in absolutely everything. I've been with him (and often Catherine as well) to all kinds of places, from small Berber villages and Lac d'Ifni to short walks here in Tisselday. I've spent nine weeks in Morocco so far this year, and there's no doubt that this is the guesthouse I'd recommend first to anyone who…",5.0

We would give this hotel 5 stars if it was possible to pay with card.

Perched on the side of a beautiful valley with greenery running along the valley floor alongside the road.  Irocha itself is small, and as is traditional in Morocco, set around an internal courtyard that provides an oasis of quiet and calm, even when (as was the case when we visited) there are strong winds in the valley.  The hotel is small, and simple, but has a rustic charm that we found intoxicating. The place is run by an incredibly friendly staff - in a quiet and incredibly casual fashion. But still with a level of service and attention to detail that is often absent in European hotels.  For me though, what made Irocha special was…",5.0
"We stopped at Irocha on the way back to Marrakech for just one night unfortunately, but this was enough to gather the special energy that this place emanates. In a few words I would describe it like that: exquisite rustic elegant simplicity! Ahmed and his team manage to offer a warm refuge to those travellers passing by, mostly stopping just one night. However, this is a place where, if I would have the option, I would choose to stay longer to absorb the good vibes that I felt when there: you can relax by the pool, plenty of walks, Ait ben Haddou is not far, etc.  Thanks for a short but very friendly stay!",5.0

I had to insist.  The door didn't lock.  The food was mediocre.  In general, the place was dingy.  A big disappointment.  I think the owners were hosting family guests and just didn't have time for paying customers.  We canceled our second night.  As I said, not worth the trip.

Nice room opened up to the pool, but way too cold to swim in January.  The second room opened onto the large spacious patio with stunning views of the mountains....  The only areas to improve are signage to find the place, which Ahmed already has in works, and a map of the area, as it was challenging finding all the landmarks our gracious host was describing.

"We were booked into Irocha Guest House by Nick Garsten, who organized our trip to Morocco. It was to be a stop between the desert and Marrakech, our last and final destination in Morocco. I had no idea of what to expect when we arrived - hot, tired, sweaty and dusty from our 3-day desert adventure and a visit to Ouarzazate. Imagine our delight upon entering the peaceful, tranquil, and whimsical Irocha Guest House. Clearly the owners have an artist's eye, as I felt that everywhere I looked - inside and outside - offered a beautiful view - things simply and artfully arranged. It was an oasis after the hustle and bustle of Ouarzazate and Ait-Ben-Haddou. Our rooms were spotless and lovely.   The terrace was delightful in the late afternoon, and we enjoyed a cocktail before a…",5.0
"With a feeling of apprehension, we left Ouarzazate without a good map or a GPS to show us the way to Tisselday, but we made it eventually. A hotel staff member came to us and carried our suitcase to the room. We were upgraded as there were very few guests. The room we slept in was incredible, spacious and tastefully designed, with our own access to the pool. There is a fireplace in the coomon area with a fireplace where we waited until food was served. Delicious home-made food, as was the home-made yogurt we had for breakfast the following morning. The views from the terrace are stunning. Great place to stay and highly recommended!",5.0
"Irocha is a fantastic oasis in the heart of Atlas Mountains and a place to relax and to take a break especially for those whom are going to the deep desert, or whom are coming back from there. Our room was very comfortable overlooking the gardens was breathtaking.

"I was on a trip from Marrakech to M'hamid and stopped at Irocha on the way for a delicious lunch and again on the way back for an overnight stay.  When I arrived, I immediately felt like this place was home to me.  Its so cozy and inviting, the decor is really warm and there are loads of interesting artifacts and just an all-around cool feeling that you get from the place and the owner.    The food is delicious and the staff are all super friendly.  It was cold weather during my stay and my room was heated perfectly, the shower was nice and hot, and the bed was cozy and warm.  Honestly staying in this place felt like staying at a relative's house because its so comfortable and not pretentious at all, yet you have all the amenities you would need or want.

"On our way from marrakech to the desert we stopped here for 1 night. The hotel is situated in a peacefull village with a few on the mountains. It is ideal to read a book on the terrace and enjoy the environment. Because the weather was a bit bad, we were mostly inside, where It was very cosy with a fireplace.  The owners are really nice. In the evening we got a three course meal: good, but a bit expensive.  Overall I highly recommend it to chill out. ",4.0
"My family and I did not stay here, but just stopped for lunch as part of a tour with Sahara Services. The place is beautiful, completely unexpected location on a hill overlooking the very small village of Tisselday and the main road connecting Ouarzazate and Marrakech. Did not see the rooms but the rest of the building was clean, tastefully decorated, and there was a nice pool too. Lunch was excellent and the service was great. It would be a great place to stop for the evening while heading out to the desert, or to stay for a while if you want something quiet and relaxing.",5.0
"J'ai vraiment bien aime Irocha, c'est super beau, tu te sent comme chez toi, tout le monde est tres gentille, et la cuisine c'est incroyable!! Ca vaut la peine gouter le charme d'Irocha, on va revenir sans doutes <3  Loved it, it's so so charming, you immediately feel like home (though it looks so much better, breathtaking view), everybody's very kind and attentive, the rooms are beautiful. Oh and the food is great!! It's definitely worth visiting, we'll come back asap!!",5.0
"Our family had a really relaxing 3 days here. For my daughter's Birthday we were treated to local musicians who came and played and sang traditional Berbere songs - really special. Both Abdell's looked after us very well and the food was wonderful. Would recommend the guided tour through the village.  If you want to go up to the castle, wear some sturdy shoes and take water as it's more challenging than it looks!",5.0

Travelling with my sister and her two kids (9 and 3yrs), we drove from Casablanca to Marrakech to Tissleday. Well sign posted, the guest house has been designed with great care in the spirit of sustainability using local material in order to fit in the local landscape. The owners (Catherine and Ahmed) hospitality and the staff kindness were exceptional. We all felt like home and extended our trip 3 more nights.

"Firstly this 'Maison d'hôtes' is NOT near the town of Ouarzazate. We do not know whose fault this is but it is 50km from Ouarzazate in the Marrakech direction so bear that in mind when booking. The village is called Tisselday. There are signs for Irocha on the roadside on both sides of the village. Being so far away from Ouarzazate was not an issue though, as we did not see anything there worth staying over for.  Once we got there, it was good.  The room was large and there was a lovely pool.   We ended up eating dinner there for three nights and the food was fantastic each night. No menu. You got what they had and it was excellent each night. The waiter and kitchen staff were excellent and very friendly. Breakfast was also very good.  On the negative side: We did not get much…",4.0
"We spent two nights in this faboulous place and enjoyed the hospitality, calm atmosphere and great food. Lovely terrace, flowers and a clean swimming pool. Also liked the lit up cabinet of fine Moroccan art objects and the box at the reception desk for tips for the personel. Climbed up to the kasbah on top of the hill and collected numerous, little rocks with different colours, shapes and forms. The valley below was green and alluring, but will have to wait for another trip of exploration!  Our guide to local sites - a Rumainian friend of the house did a great job! Thanks for everything!",5.0
"Throughout our week traveling outside Marrakesh, we chose not to make any reservations in order to see the available rooms and negotiate prices. We found a lot of hotels websites and tripadvisor pictures were deceiving.   We were surprised with this lovely hotel.  We negotiated a little to lower the price and we ended up taking the last two rooms.  We found the main difference between French owned and Moroccan owned to be the availability of alcohol and pools. The pool here was lovely for a dip and the mojitos great, but you do pay more for these amenities. Big towels were available for your shower and for the pool.   Wifi is available in the main lounge area, but didn't work on my computer.   The location of the hotel is lovely and there are several areas for you to sit outside…",4.0
"Irocha is very much a manifestation of Ahmed's wonderful personality - generous, interesting and committed.  It is a glorious place to stay.  The rooms and public spaces are all attractive, comfortable and well-maintained, the food delicious, the staff delightful and the setting dramatic.  But, more than anything else, it is Ahmed's wish to share the beauty and the fascination of the surrounding countryside and communities which makes Irocha so special.  He always gave time to help us understand the local people and places we encountered on our walks and even took us way up into the mountains in his 4X4 to visit a very isolated village.  We had a very special experience at Irocha.",5.0

Pros - property is in a unique position overlooking a valley that hypnotizes, it has plenty of different areas to enjoy, lounge/dining room/terrace are great, pool is perfect maintained to a 24-26 degrees C temperature and very comfortable. All ideal after the 3h drive across the mountains that leaves many a passenger a bit dizzy! - our room (suite) for 6 nights had the last night free!, perfectly situated of the interior patio and we slept so well. You can hear the occasional truck at night on the road or early riser heading off but this was almost comforting. - staff were very attentive but never intrusive, anything we needed they went out of their way to get us. …",4.0
"My family and I stayed in this wonderful little hotel for three nights, and it remains one of my best memories of our travels to Morocco.  Although hard to find, getting there was half the fun! We arrived late at night as we took an incorrect turning. Despite this, all the staff stayed awake and were ready to greet us when we arrived, and had even made some dinner for us, for which we were eternally grateful.  The simple, yet stylish decor of the hotel makes it extremely charming. All the staff were extremely helpful, friendly and geniuine. The pool is fantastic to swim in during the hot hours of the day, and we also took a cooking class which was a great experience.  I highly recommend Irocha and will go back without a doubt when I am next in Marocco! ",5.0
"We stayed here for 1 night on our way from the Desert Camp to Marrakech. Our rooms were decent for spending a night, but small if you have a 3rd person.

The bar is well stocked and the food is great.",3.0

We had been traveling for 10 days when we arrived. We were really happy to spend a day and a half relaxing. We ate all our meals there and enjoyed them all. The staff is very caring. The only complaint I have is their hammom . It is a do it yourself . I have travelled all over and never experienced this before. It is dangerous with the boiling water. That did not spoil our stay at this magnificent place.  ,5.0

"My spouse and I spent 4 nights at Irocha after some High Atlas hiking.  The hospitality was outstanding,  the food was amazing, and the views from the terrace over the green valleys were superb.  There are many nooks around the outdoor terrace and gardens, so there are many places to escape if you want to read or contemplate in solitude.  There are also several inviting areas to congregate and socialize with other guests.  Because of these many ""zones,"" the place never feels crowded  even when it's full.  The pool is very clean and well cared for.  For those who enjoy an evening apéritif on the terrace, they offer full bar services to their guests without hesitation.

After a lovely hot tea we passed out by 7pm and stayed asleep until morning so we missed dinner. Our room was very authentic to the dwelling. Stone walls, comfy bed. Honestly we just passed out after almost 24 hrs of travel. The next morning we had a delicious breakfast of homemade yogurt, coffee or tea, juice toast and Pancake along with butter and jams. We left by 8am for our continued travel. Would have loved to explore and spend some more time here.",5.0

The rooms are a little small and dated, but the common areas, including the salon, pool and outside terrace were beautiful.  Irocha really understands the essence of hospitality.",4.0

"After a long drive from Merzhouga, we eventually found Irocha. It is in the village of Tisselday, about 15 km past Amerzgane on R9 going towards Marakesh from Ourzazate. There are a number of signs on the road and the green sign marks the beginning of a steep track up to the guest house/hotel. We were beat, but our hosts met us with an offer of tea and some time to relax, but getting to our room was a priority, which was met with grace. We went to the eating area and had a rest, and dinner soon followed. Very acceptable as we both had ""Morocco stomach"". The room, in spite of being on the road side, was very quiet and cool, so the A/C was not needed the first night.

Set out with gardens, terraces, a pool and hamam, its a delightful and beautiful location. Abdullah is a charming host who fired the hamam for us to scrub the desert off ourselves below relaxing by the pool.

All of which is served with stunning views up the valley from I've of the multiple terraces.   Rooms are comfortable…",5.0

This establishment is a half hour drive out of Ouzarrzate on the road to Marrakech. Keep an eye out for the signs in the village of Tisselday. Good setup with reasonable rooms and reasonable meals and attentive service and generally pretty quiet...

"Irocha is an ideal place to stay when touring the southern Atlas. It is set in a green valley just off one of the passes. However, it is very quiet and peaceful. The views from the terrace are magnificant, particularly in the evening. The facilities are very good, with nice, clean rooms and a good pool. There is plenty of indoor and outdoor sitting around space. The food was very tasty - probably the best we had in hotels. The real highlight is the staff who were so kind and considerate. They made us feel welcome and special and nothing was too much trouble. We stayed on two occasions and both times were treated like friends with great warmth and humour. Highly recommended.",5.0
"The location and position of the hotel was good, the staff were friendly enough. However it lacked the warmth of Moroccan hospitality we have since experienced on our trip around the south of morocco.  Partly because we booked through booking.com via the the trip advisor website, it was expensive for what it was. In particular the breakfast of toasted stale bread and coffee or hot chocolate was particularly poor for 5 euros. The food for dinner was good but nearly the exact same thing was served both nights. Again this was expensive at 45 euros for 2 adults, 2 children.  In short, this place did not meet our expectations, however it was good enough.",3.0

The staff organizes hiking tours nearby with the possibility to visit old villages in the mountain...we'll keep it for next time. Very good value for money, with good food at breakfast and dinner.

The views are wonderful, and the hotel catches the sun from early morning until the sun sets behind the opposite wall of the valley. The food was tasty and plentiful, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and the room was cosy and inviting. The evening entertainment was fun and inclusive, and embodied much of what I enjoyed about the hotel.  The ruined kasbah on the edge of a nearby cliff can be climbed to in approx 40-45 mins and offers a spectacular view. Personally, I recommend setting off at about 3pm, to miss the blast of the midday sun, but also to catch the glorious colours the setting sun throws across the valley.

I stayed at Irocha for several days last August. Its a wonderful place to recharge for a few days and relax. The rooms are very comfortable and well appointed and the pool is spectacular. I spent many an hour relaxing there and escaping the summer heat. The food was varied and delicious and the manager was very attentive and always open to a good chat. The distance from Ouarzazate can be a plus or minus depending on your goals. Its about 40-50km away which is nice if you want to spend some time away from cities in a more relaxed local environment as I did but might be too far to use as a base for spending substantial time in Ouarzazate.,4.0
"Hotel Irocha - Ouarzazate  It is about 50kms away from the town proper of Ouarzazate so if the plan is to make a pit stop to rest and spend the night - this is a good place. Quiet and peaceful with a nice fireplace to relax and chill after a long day of driving. Abdul was a good host to us .. the only thing is that there was a time in the evening when we couldn't find anyone to help us with the heater.. else everything was ok. Wifi is pretty OK with some intermittent connection but gets things done. Now, if the intent is to see the city of Ouarzazate and spend some time to see the local area then Irocha may be too far from the town proper for that. From a timing perspective, we arrived late in the afternoon, relaxed in the evening, had a good warm shower in the morning and…",4.0
"Stayed here for one night on way back from desert to Marrakech, and was not disappointed. Beautiful location perched above the village overlooking the valley, what a wonderful vantage point to sit and eat breakfast and dinner on the terrace. The only down side is the road is quite noisy, but this quietens in the evening. The staff are welcoming, the food delicious (complete with musicians in the evening) and the rooms perfectly adequate. In all, good value, and perfect for an overnight stop. The pool is a surprisingly decent size for those of us who like to be able to swim a length, as well as having a good view of a crumbling kasbah perched high on the nearby clifftop.",5.0

Irocha is tucked away amongst the dwellings of a real Morrocan village. The welcome was genuine and all the staff were so kind and humble. The riad is a complex of various rooms and seating areas all beautifully decorated with fabulous views across the valley. The rooms are all individual and as a family of 4 we were kindly offered 2 rooms, which the children thoroughly enjoyed, as did the parents after a 4 hour trip.

The food was among the best we had all holiday and the owner and staff were all brilliant. Though we didn't make use of the pool, it looked amazing and it's a shame we didn't have time for a swim. The rooms were fantastic and very well priced, and the bed was the best I've ever slept in. There was also a very well stocked bar, ranging from beer to whiskey at fair prices for Morocco. The only thing I'd say is you'd need a car to access it, but other than that I would thoroughly recommend.",5.0

It is a quaint, intimate and romantic Riad that is worth the trip in it’s own right.  We only had one evening to spend there, but it would be a great location to use as the headquarters for exploring this area of natural beauty.  The food was amazing, and the dining deck has a great view of the mountains and river below.  The bed was very comfortable (not always the case in Morocco!).

The rooms are understated, almost ""shabby chic"" but very definitely chic.  The communal areas were delightful, the views breathtaking, the pool a great refuge from the July heat.

The room was beautiful: a sort of bohemian luxury in a relaxed and original manner. We all loved it.   The location is perfect for walking tours in the area and excursions to Ouarzazate.

"This charming little guest house was one of our favorites on our trip through Morocco, beating out many a ""fancier"" establishment with its simple decor and lovely views.  Simple, tasteful rooms - Berber with Western comforts like extra fluffy towels and a roaring fire by the dinner table- were a relief after we got back from two days in the Sahara.  And the views from the lovely, but simply-appointed terrace are simply stunning.  Run by a Moroccan man (a geologist who is happy to talk rock formations in the Anti Atlas) and his French wife, the clientele seemed to be mostly French, so perhaps it has yet to be discovered by the English-speaking, Lonely Planet crowd and is a little off-the-beaten-path.

The reason for a repeat trip was due to the excellent setting and hospitality on the previous visit – the later had TOTALLY disappeared. The brothers who run the hotel were not seen. The staff were on the rude side of unfriendly.   Supper was scheduled for 1930 – however it was almost 2015 before Harira soup arrived. The intervening 45 minutes were spent listening to exceptionally loud live Moroccan music providing by three men – accompanied in the background by a Power Balads CD that was playing on the music system! The main course of tagine was…,1.0
"From the previous review it seems October was a bad time to visit - or it's going downhill (would explain the lack of maintenance) - or you only get good treatment if a valued tour group? Here's the review I submitted to Alastair Sawday where I got the original recommendation - unfortunately Alastair S doesn't publish bad reviews, but I thought this should be shared: We'd recommend only if you needed a spot to stop for a night Marrakesh side of Ouarzazate. Good food, nice patio for breakfast but not the standard or service expected of an Alastair Sawday recommendation. On booking we'd informed Irocha we'd be on honeymoon but suspect it was our late arrival rather than consideration for our reasons for visiting or how long we were staying (4 nights) that meant we were placed in…",2.0
"i travelled three weeks with my grilfriend en son through Marocco, in every hotel and riad we met friendship and hospitality. The contradiction with Irocha was tremendous. No welcome, no small talk, no explenation about irocha itself. The owners had a bad mood, no smile or something what looked like it. Especially in a remote place as Irocha, a warm welcome is essential to feel a little at home. Staff and food was ok, surroundings beautiful. Rooms basic. If you can find something simelar on your way to Marakech or Ouerzazate, go for it!! For example Jardin de Skoura in Skoura.",2.0
"This hotel was our first stop after arriving in Morocco, and what a wonderful introduction to Morrocan design and culturer!  The hotel is charming and delightful, with friendly staff and fantastic views.   It is quite basic in terms of the rooms but a gem nonetheless.  The dinner included in the rate was also very good, and breakfast served on the terrace overlooking the valleys and mountains was fabulous.  I particularly loved the home made yoghurt which was served in the same glass jars it is set in.",4.0

The owner Ahmed could  not have been more charming and hospitable. The views are spectacular the food delicious and the atmosphere so welcoming. There were quite a few patrons who were there for treking and other like us who were first timers and staying longer because they felt at home. It is definetly worth a stop and a visit, we will for surely return.",4.0
"We stayed here for 2 nights on our way back to Marrakech.  The location is stunning with fantastic mountain and valley views.  There is a great terrace to sit and soak up the sun and views -although it perhaps needs a few more comfortable chairs. The staff were friendly and attentive and the food was very tasty (especially the goats yoghurt for breakfast !).  We enjoyed walking up to the Kasbah nearby which is a steep climb but well worth it. The only negative things is that our room didn't get cleaned and the heating in the room didn't seem to warm the room at all at night (it was cold at night!).  We had lunch one day which was salad and brochettes and were charged £10 each which seemed a tad expensive for what it was.   Despite this, we really enjoyed our stay and would very…",5.0

We stayed in winter and the rooms are chilly, as there is no heat, but this is common throughout the entire country. They do have gas heaters for the rooms but they cannot be left on during the night.  The slight chill was a small price to pay for everythign else this hotel has to offer.

We arrived in the middle of a power cut and could not even use our bathroom in the smaller room without using a torch (flashlight), as there were no windows in the room and it was incredibly small.  We asked for lunch and was offered only a salad, which was ok, if a little small for four people. The accompanying bread was a little stale but the beers were cold.

Although most of the reviews of this property are not very good we were very satisfied. We arrived late after a long day on the road but were able to have a swim before having dinner at a poolside table. The hotel doesn't serve alcohol but they were happy to put our own bottle of wine in the fridge. Both dinner and breakfast were very good so I would say this hotel represents good value for money.

"Considering one is on the fringe of civilization when one visits Ouarzazate then I guess the hotel is acceptable. For a reasonable price one gets a clean room and a comfy (huge) bed - nothing more nothing less. There is virtually no other choice if one wants to reside at a hotel  that is compatible with European standards. The room is decorated minimalistic but modern. This far for 3*. The big drawback is that you one hears everything in the adjacent rooms (above, below, to the left, to the right, in the passage and across the passage).  I guess most visitors don’t really stay longer than 1 night (or maybe 2 at the most). Ouarzazate ist really a holiday destination but more a transit necessity.

"My Gate 1 tour spent 1 night here between Erfoud and Marrakech. After a long day on the road, it was a welcome sight. It’s a relatively small hotel with a small lobby. For the people 50 and over, the rooms reminded us of our dorm rooms, small, rather drab, but had our own bathroom. Some people had older hairdryers, but some (like myself), had none. My room was clean and comfortable. Definitely bare bones, but......fine for one night. The outdoor pool and nearby bar and game room was good. The dining room where we had our buffet dinner and breakfast was nice and I heard no one complaining about the food. It didn’t seem like there was much to see nearby, but we were all so tired, it didn’t matter to any of us. Just needed a bed, sleep and up the next morning to go to Marrakech. ",3.0

I stayed here with a tour. Rooms were very small and the beds were uncomfortable. I can live with those but the real problem was the food. The buffet dinner was included with our tour.

Well yes the rooms are small and yes they had no toiletries except shampoo that was open from  the previous guest and no hairdryer which we expected. but the hotel was, to say in nice words, not clean. We took pictures of the bathroom that showed hair of previous guest/guests on the toilet. Tissue paper on the floor an a moldy bathroom door. This is sub par to any hotel. The walls next to the bed were stained with what's seemed to be hand prints.",2.0

The hotel called my tour director and told him I left my cash in the room and to give me the amount and they would reimburse him the money.

There was an extremely limited choice and supply of food following on from a “first sitting” by another large group of guests.

In terms of our room, our repeated requests for hand towels and two additional pillows to be sent to our room were simply ignored by hotel staff and this combined with the fact that no hairdryer was available for our use made our stay both unnecessarily stressful and very uncomfortable.

There is a nice pool on the property with a hammock and some tables and chairs to relax in. The WiFi is quite strong, so that’s a huge plus.   The buffet restaurant was just ok.

Not at reception nor in the bar nor at breakfast. Yes they help you when you ask but nothing extra... Breakfast is fine, just what you expect and no surprises at the bar.

The clerk was on the phone,  he never acknowledged  me, but saw me with my tablet,  printed a paper, shoved it in my hand he & walked away, poor customer service, even check in customer service was poor.

Free parking.  However, the bathroom was a let-down. Water flowed out from the shower cubicle, constant ""hissing"" sound from cistern (room 304) was distracting. Only 1 tiny soap for 2 persons.

"This hotel is near the world historic kasbah, some shops, and the movie museum.  It's a sort of long walk to the center of town or a short taxi.  The rooms are pretty standard.  The poolside is very lovely, as are the common areas of the hotel. There was hair on the sheets on towels, but I had I the impression that they were clean but lacked a good dryer filter (or air dried the sheets and towels). The restaurant is nice although overpriced for Morocco.  One drawback is that there is a very noisy nearby nightclub.  The noise isn't bad with the window shut, but it's stuffy in the rooms in the winter with the window shut even with the AC on.  Overall I really enjoyed my stay and I think it's a good option for a reasonably priced hotel in Oz.",4.0

The rooms are quite small with clean bedding, comfy beds, good sized shower room and walk in shower which was very efficient.  Wi-Fi worked well. Our room had a lovely view over the town to the High Atlas.  The breakfast and dinner buffets were standard as for all the hotels we stayed in.  Only problem was a lack of spoons.  Nothing else really to say about it, when inside you could be anywhere but for one night that didn’t really matter.",3.0

Our room had a water leak from the shower into the bedroom room via the floor boards. Definitely not the lovely riad experience we had the night before, but it is very central. Breakfast was a buffet, with a fair bit of variety but very ordinary. The pool area was very peasant, however.",3.0
"The Kasbah-inspired exterior, pool area and grounds looked good enough for a one-night stay and the free wi-fi was definitely a plus. The rooms though were pretty basic, not extremely clean, the bathroom smelled pretty bad and the shower wasn’t draining properly. The bed was not very comfy either, but after an extremely long journey we were just happy to just get some rest.   For the record, the Marrakech-Ouarzazate route is quite interesting to see, but if you are a motion-sickness sufferer, be warned: the coach travel with either Supratour/CTM etc. is no joyride!

The hotel is a little above the average IBIS in terms of the room size and quality. Our room was well maintained while we were there and the staff were polite and helpful. My only complaint is there was an awful smell in and around the main lobby. There is something seriously wrong with the plumbing in this hotel that needs to be addressed.",3.0

Then we got the towels which are supposed to be white but where yellow  like with stains in them. They also smelled awfull!!!

The restaurant is a little overpriced but offers different options to the standard fare of tangines and we tried some very good Saharan wine.

Otherwise the room & bathroom are adequate for a short stay & HOORAY! brightly enough lit to read. They were rather mean with towels, though - only one small bath-towel each, no hand-towels.

The room comes with a double bed and a single extra bed which can sleep 3. The air-conditioner is working but not cold enough for a warm day in Ouarzazate. The rooms are much cleaner and so is the bathroom. Overall for a price of about 389 dh (Booked in advance), it is a steal!",4.0

Free lightning speed wifi in all the rooms and public areas.  Nice outdoor pool and lounge chairs.  Pretty good food.

Word of caution - Choose somewhere other than the hotel to eat!! Breakfast was sparse at best.  Lousy actually in anyone's opinion. Dinner also was bad.  We were in a large group and nearly everyone who ate there the first night became ill. (coincidence? Maybe)  We ate elsewhere the next night, and those who didn't said the food appeared as left over.",4.0

Seems you need a special permit to serve alcohol and they did not feel it a necessity  watched the final game of the Championship League between Bayern Munchen and Chelsea and it is no fun with no beer. The lobby also is very hot and not the most comfortable place to watch a game of this magnitude. But as for some reason they did not have the game in the rooms. We had no other choice.",4.0
"Like other reviewers, we find this place OK -but no more than that.  but the rooms are dark and dingy,  the pool is cramped and the reception staff are unhelpful; Morocco reinstated the Summertime clock change while we were there - no-one mentioned it so we missed the Supratours bus back to Marrakech and had to take the ""local's"" bus across the Atlas- an interesting experience but one we could have done without on the last day of our holiday - and whereas the Suoratours coach arrives at the Station complex in Marrakech, the one we arrived at  would make a good setting for a disaster movie  We did get a good rate via Laterooms - but just across the road is the IBIS - part of the same chain and with a much nicer pool",3.0
Good location in centre of town. Room a little tired and dissapointed with lack of view and very dark interior.  Wifi only in reception and not in rooms. Reception staff unfriendly.

This is VERY important if you have kids.  Buffet breakfast was ok too.  WiFi in the lobby worked just fine.  We had a bunch of laundry done here and it was done well and back the same day.  The front desk exchanged travelers' checks for us too.  The desk clerk was very nice.  The beds were okay - not great, but certainly good enough.  The only problem was that the outdoor walkways had huge puddles after the rain/hail storm, but that was a very unusual event.",4.0

Nescafe, not real coffee, awful selections not kept stocked without nagging, all for just about 6 Euros pp. Did I mention the lukewarm scrambled eggs that gave me nasty food poisoning? A week later and I'm still sick. Still, that's a danger of chafing dish food everywhere, and generally I was happy with the stay, if not the resto, so they get a 3.",3.0

There is a disco just next to the place, you can choose if that's a positive or a negative. So earplugs on a saturdaynight for a bad sleeper is a good option!",3.0
"We stayed here on the second and sixth nights of a tour of Morocco. It really was a nice place to stay. From a brand such as Ibis, you know what to expect. Clean, relatively basic but comfortable. Wifi was really good to keep us in touch with friends back home. Dinner was very good though breakfast left much to be desired - otherwise this would have been 5 stars. Rooms were clean and functional. No noise was able to get in from outside. TV had limited english speaking channels but the one news channel which I could find kept us in the know. The only thing which could have made the room a little better was to have an extra socket and a chiller for water but again, you get what you pay for. For what we as a group needed, this hotel was absolutely brilliant.",4.0

"This hotel is not the most luxurious of Ouarzazate, but it reaches easilly 4 stars. If you are looking for a boutique-style hotel, then pick this one. The staff is great, the old-fashion stone decoration is elegant. You'll appreciate the buffet breakfast with an incredible direct view on the kasbah. The small swimming pool is great too, very deep. You'll enjoy this quiet hotel if you are on a romance/culture/relaxation trip. I highly recommand this hotel instead of the over-crowded ""berbere palace"", the later might be luxurious, but you don't want to walk on people during your holidays, do you?",5.0
This hotel seems to be of a similar standard style of the maroccan Ibis hotels. We booked one night in the internet for a nice price. The room we stayed was comfortable for a short stay. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel!  The room was very quiet and it was clean. You got free parking and internet access! The staff was very helpful!,4.0

We've stayed for 2 nights in this hotel and I would stay more and more! We arrived around 10pm and the check in was really fast as we REALLY need to eat something (after 5 hours in a bus from Marrakesh to Ouarzazate). We went to the room but only left the luggage and went straight for the dinner. We had the buffet and the food was good. The waiter was marvelous even shooing a cat from my friend. A true customer service agent. When we finally went to the room we start realizing how beautiful the hotel is. It really looks like a kasbah and the rooms are really nice. The air conditioning helped a LOT! The bathroom was really nice. Typically Moroccan. The views you get from the hotel are stunning.

"We had booked for three nights, but extended our stay for another night. We were very happy with the hotel. Room was spacious and comfortable. Carpet in the room was a bit strange - felt like outdoor carpet. Breakfast wasn't included in our package, and we ate there once, but it wasn't good value for what you get. Dinner menu lacked choice, but there are good restaurants in walking distance. Quite convenient to the town square and kasbah, but up a steep hill so don't try dragging your luggage from the bus. Good views and nice gardens and pool. Reception staff very helpful.",4.0
"We stayed here as part of a large tour group.  Because we were triple room occupancy and the rooms were small, we had 2 connecting rooms.  Room 225 had one queen bed and room 227 had 2 single beds.

The AC in the room didn't work too well but thankfully it wasn't a hot night.  There were no fridges or hair dryers in the room.  Both rooms had carpet flooring and overlook the pool and the Kasbah Taourirt beyond, which is a short 10 minute walk away.

"Mercure-generally a good name in the hotel world, not really living up to it here in sleepy Ouarzazate. The staff we found to be rather rude and just plain inconsiderate. We were the only two of five guests staying at the property and despite this fact, we were still given two single beds pushed together rather than one queen size bed (which they had plenty of!) We pleaded with them the next day and they did move us to a room with one bed. Breakfast was barely edible, and the kitchen staff rude and annoyed that were there. Whatever you do, don't eat in the restaurant for dinner-the food was disgusting and more expensive than anywhere else we'd been in Morocco! The maids pounded on the door at 7:30am each morning to clean our room even after we requested the front desk to just…",2.0
"It's a Mercure and tries to live up to this middle of the road chain standards but does not quite make it.  On the positive side the location is good, about a 5min walk to te kasbah and 20min to the main town.  The overall design is good also with little courtyard rooms in a Moroccan style and decorated extensively with mosaic tiles.  They are small though and just not that clean.  The dining room was too small for the two tour groups and other guests and chaotic at times, especially breakfast.",3.0
"Located right across the road from Ouarzazate's main attraction, the ksar (old walled city) the Mercure filled our need for a quick and easy hotel to get in and out of after our week in the Moroccan dessert.  We desperately missed the character and warm welcome of the Riads and hotels we enjoyed during our prior eight days in Morocco.  Even though the hotel was almost empty on an off-season Sunday night, we couldn't get them to change of turn off the '80s top-ten western tunes in the lobby, where we had to sit in order to access the ""wifi.""

There was no bell service at this hotel and he thought we would hate it. We almost switched to the Berber Palace just for 1 night. Glad we didn't for as it turned out we were extremely impressed.  OK, the room was on the small side and very simply furnished with no frills. The bathroom was however nice, bright with a very good power shower. The breakfast was self-service but there was plenty of choice...really good coffees and yummy pikelets. On top of all that, we got pleasant service, central location, comfortable bed and fast internet access, what more would one need for a stopover? Oh, a nice big…",4.0
"First of all, we got a great deal on this hotel online. The rooms are comfortable and clean. The hotel was quite quiet when we visited which was nice although we did get the impression that it was more of a 'stop-off' hotel than one that you would spend any considerable amount of time in. We stayed for 3 nights. The restaraunt was ok. The pool was nice and it caught the sun throughout the day. Location of the hotel was good for travelling further into the desert although there is not much to do in Ouarzazate. We would recomend this hotel if you needed to stop off on your way down to the desert.",3.0
"Very nice and clean hotel, with traditional Morrocan decoration. Every room has its name acording name of Minerals (nice idea). Hotel staff is friendly and helpfull.

"During our 17 day tour in Morroco we stayed in riads and kasbahs, so this place was certainly a ""style break"". Other nice (reasonbly priced) hotels in Ouarzazate were already fully booked, so we decided to take the Ibis but it was good and efficient. The outside has a Kasbah-look (nice as it integrates with the other buildings in the neighborhood) but inside it is certainly an Ibis. Same standard rooms in the same color as elsewhere in the world. No charm, no frills but with a confortable bed, convenient bathroom, a perfect working airco (was needed in mid-August), friendly staff and standard buffet breakfast. Major assets were a nice large swimming pool and its location (walking distance from the city center and Taourirt Kasbah and Ensemble Artisanal).",3.0
"My stay in Ouarzazate was just for 1 night enroute to Marrakesh.  The Ibis is located near other hotels in Ouarzazate such as the Mercure, Belere (there were protests from staff outside who had not been paid wages from February).  It only a short 10 minute walk into town to buy groceries, snacks or drinks.  Breakfast was served in the restaurant - it is small-average in size but the buffet breakfast has a variety of bread / croissants / pastries etc to select from.  It is nothing over the top but it is sufficient.  Dinner also was pleasant and we had some set menus which we ate.  The rooms are clean, have a telephone, TV but no minibar/fridge.  The bathroom is small just with a shower, toilet and handbasin with shampoo and soap.  Towels were also very clean as was the bed linen.…",3.0

Actually it as quite a surprise, as we met a very friendly staff, nice swiming pool where we spent much of the afternoon relaxing, and a very good room, clean and confortable. We booked an early breakfast served at 5:00 am, it was still great even though limited from the regular ones (7:00 onwards). Hotel had free internet access on a PC at the lobby. Sorry IBIS, but this is not an IBIS!",5.0

"This is an Ibis enough said. Identical rooms standard fittings and style, absolutely no flair whatsoever. This is the classic bed for the night no frills, no real service standards and average everything else. It was cleaner than the Ibis Casablanca and the staff were better than the terrible customer service in Casablanca but marginally. These are not a great chain of hotels. Management need to rethink their formula world wide but perhaps the tour companies are happy to pay the average price and put their customers into the low standard hotels. I guess we should tell the tour companies not to use Ibis I certainly said that in my tour evaluation.",3.0
"Ouarzazate is a pretty ordinary place, memorable only for the fact that occasionally an international film production bases itself there, or the proximity to must-see places like Ait Benhaddou. The Ibis is pretty ordinary too - don't expect too much other than reasonable value for money. Very poor F&B, but decent enough rooms. OK for 2-3 nights, but I owuld go mad if any longer...",3.0
"Loved this hotel. After a few nights in noisy riads, we were so happy to finally get a good night sleep. Riads are full of charm and pretty but rarely constructed in way to be sound proof. Finally, only at the Ibis, we were finally able to sleep well.   This hotel is very well located, quite, clean and well priced. The rooms decorated ""a la IBIS"", are very simple and bland, but it works. Its compact but practical. Beds are comfy too.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5.0
"We searched Ouarzazate for hotels/riads/kasbahs, and there is not alot of choice.  All the boutique places are very overpriced, so we opted for the Mercure.  It has less character, but is also alot less expensive.  The rooms are small, the building old, but the bar is funky with great views over the old kasbah.  Being Accor, there are no real surprises, but I did not think it was as good as a Mercure should be.  There is an Ibis right next door (also Accor), which is just a comfortable, more modern and less expensive, so we stayed there on our return and just used the Mercure bar.  World of warning...

The rooms are small, but clean and perfectly adequate. There is a nice pool area (it was too cold for us, but would be great in summer) and basic restaurant.  From what we saw (we looked at several hotels in town) it is probably the best option around at a reasonable price point.",4.0

Front desk staff were efficient but not very friendly.  We were looking forward to dining in the restaurant which was recommended in our guide book. However, when we tried to do so, there was only a big tent in the yard and once we entered, we realised that they were only catering for tour groups, with a big buffet on the side of the room and all tables for 10.

Despite advertising it in their service directory, there were no English channels on the TV... which usually wouldnt matter, except it was 46-50 degrees outside, so pool or TV were the only daytime options. The pool was cold and refreshing, but no wow factor. They dont turn on the waterfall (perhaps because it was Summer??). The room was really small. Just beds, desk and TV. No room for a sofa or lounge chair. The empty mini-bar fridge struggled to make anything cold. Despite the air conditioning on 5 degrees, it never got cold in this room.

Ouarzazate is a nice quiet town with wide roads and a nice laid back feel to it. It is a 4 hour drive from Marrakesh across the Atlas mountains. It's a break from the bustle of Marrakesh and is very friendly. Good base to tour the gorges or set off further into the Sahara. 10 mins from the Ait Benhaddou world heritage site. We liked this town a lot.  Ibis is on a small hill, just across the road from the Kasbah in an area made up of 3, 4* hotels. Plenty of choice.

The swimming pool scene is OK with (again) fantastic views but don’t stay to long with young children. Think they will be bored soon because of the small pool and small terrace.

"This was  a good modern typical chain hotel with all the usual amenities, and made a nice change from the various riads and kasbahs we had been staying in beforehand (even though we had enjoyed the experience). The room was pleasant with a very comfortable bed. The balconies seem to vary in size - ours was quite a good size, shared with the room next door- but none of them had any chairs or tables, which was a bit strange.  Good breakfast buffet, but mediocre dinner buffet - better to eat out in the evening.   There is a nice heated outdoor pool, which I was able to use even in January, with sunbeds around it.  Easy walking distance to the kasbah, and in a pleasant part of town. Atlas studios are a short drive away and worth a visit.",4.0
"The Ibis is a fairly new hotel and that may have been the problem.  The deadlock on my room wouldn't engage (clearly the wood had not been chiseled out properly in the door frame opposite to let the deadbolt slide into position) and the carpet gripper at the entrance to the bathroom sprang to life when I stepped on it!  (I wonder how many other people had stayed in the room without the benefit of the deadbolt.  It hadn't been fixed by the time I checked out the next morning but I saw a handyman walking around with a tool box).  Other than  that, it is a lovely hotel.  The rooms are fine and the hot shower after a day in the desert was so good!!!  The food was good (even if the restaurant was a little gloomy in the evening) - one of the best breakfasts I had in Morocco.",4.0
It's such a cliche but the Mercure really was an oasis in the desert! Fantastically designed hotel with luxurious bar and nice swimming pool. Massages were only 150dh (less than £10).

We enjoyed quiet time by the pool, which didn't quite fit into the otherwise beautiful setting, because it was outfitted with a plastic foil that looked pretty cheap and came loose at some places. They have parking on the lot which made it easy with our rental car. Martine, one of the owners only speaks French. My French is not that good, but we tried to communicate in French. The breakfast was ok, typical for the area, local pancakes, fresh squeezed orange juice, coffee/tea and natural yogurt. What i didn't understand was why they would cut the traditional flatbread in mini triangles and then again cut in top and bottom part. It looked like leftover bread from the night before. Sorry, but i have to admit, i was pretty disappointed about that fact. French love good food and bread is a stable and important element of their cuisine. The room price was higher than what the internet showed us when we googled the place right before our arrival. We didn't make reservations, since we knew they had at least two rooms available. Instead of $61 for the available room, we actually paid $74.50 i.e. 1432 Dirham in CASH, since they don't take US Dollars, only Euro or Dirham. We didn't argue and paid what we were told.

The cost is around $150  dirhams ( 3 times more that a tagine you get in the main plaza ) but it is worth it bause it is prepare exclusive for the people whom is going to dine that night so you have to tell them in advance.

The dinner we had at the guest house was the best dinner we had on our entire trip and there is even the option to have wine and beer. They were very accommodating in serving us breakfast early so we could catch our bus and they even drove us to the bus station free of charge. I would highly recommend this guest house if you're looking for a luxurious stay with awesome food! It was a great place to stay after spending the night in the desert camping,5.0
"This hotel is rather new and modern with very good rooms, in an Arabian design with all modern amenities Nice pool area/ yard Friendly French owners Quite sufficient breakfast including home made yoghurt The location is in a modern residential section approx 1 km from downtown  ",4.0
"This boutique hotel is very attractively designed with interesting furnishings in the rooms as well as the common rooms.  While the owners primarily speak French, they were anxious to help us with our general questions in English and we were fine.  We were so pleased with the hotel we returned for an additional night several days later.  The owners also gave us a great recommendation for a clean and reasonably-priced restaurant within walking distance on the main square.  The hotel was a little challenging to find the first night, but we followed Google maps it led us directly to the front door.",5.0

The service is flawless, nice, big enough (and necessary swiming pool) Very good tipical breackfast and ""perfect"" dinner only by request in advance (worth it) Ourzazate is the perfect town from where to make excursions to the hyperinteresting south of Maroc where you will find from movie Studios to breathtaking views of the Atlas mountains, a dessert full of different shades and colors, and a different and unexpected view every corner.

"Although our arrival was delayed to due road closures by many hours, the owners of this inn prepared a lovely dinner at a late hour.  We couldn't see much in the dark, and were delighted to see a beautiful facility in the daylight.  Our room was basic and clean, and the pool was alluring but the weather too cool for a dip.

"We stayed here for 2 days in April, couple with one child. The B&B is nicely organised around a swimming pool, which however was still too cold to swim in April. Owners were very friendly. We had a room on the top floor which was OK, though with very small shower and what was worse almost no water (very low pressure). We also had dinner in the Dar one evening, which was OK, though I would recommend eating outside as there are definitively better options on Ouarzazate. Overall experience was good, but we did not have the 'wow' feeling which we expected from other reviews or which you would expect from lonely planet's star rating.",3.0
"On our way back from the desert towards Marrakech we stopped in this charming B&B. The very welcoming French owners provided us with a great room by the pool. Dinner, a Tagine with a slight French/European touch, was very welcome and tasted great. A very good place to stay when retreating from the busy and hot city of Ouarzazate. ",5.0
"The hotel is very beautiful and well located. The rooms are large, tidy and functional, as are the reception and the poolside areas.

"Lovely big room by the pool (albeit it was too cold in Feb to actually use it unfortunately!) The room was very clean and comfortable. The owners were lovely and tried to help us as much as possible to organise things, although it would be easier if you can speak French as opposed to English. The breakfast was excellent with lots of food & variety! The property is just a little out of the main centre but only a 10 minute walk in which was very pleasant and quite easy with the owner's map. The wifi either didn't work or was quite slow in the room but we could always get access when we went over to the main house at least. For the price I also expected some free bottled water and toiletries to be available in the room but there wasn't any unfortunately. Overall this is a lovely,…",4.0
"We stayed here twice for a total of four nights.  This was an immaculate and artfully decorated villa in a central location with easy walking to restaurants and banks and the CTM bus station.  Breakfasts were generous and delicious, and presented on interesting hand crafted pottery.  Rooms were large and spacious, very nice bathrooms with great showers, and heat in the rooms.  Hosts Jean and Martine were extremely welcoming and helpful (Jean picked us up at the CTM bus terminal).  The rooms are on 2 levels around a central courtyard with a large swimming pool.  We highly recommend this as a place to stay.",5.0
"My wife, son (14) and I stayed at Dar Bergui Jan. 1-2.  We arrived by Supratours bus from Marrakesh and Jean Michel kindly picked us up at the bus stop and drove us to the riad which is up on a hillside overlooking Ouarzazate.  The owners, Jean Michel and Martine, could not have been nicer and more welcoming.  They gave us tea and homemade cookies when we arrived.  We were in a big room overlooking the pool (too cold in January to swim).  While we were there workmen were finishing work on a little waterfall as well.   It's a 10-15 minute walk to the main square.  We ate dinner both nights at Dar Bergui and the food was magnificent.  Lovely view of the Atlas Mountains from our room.",5.0
"We arrived a day early in Ouarzazate and luckily, we were referred to this riad. We were warmly welcomed and felt at home immediately. After nights of being cold in the desert, we were ecstatic that the room had heating, after all it was January. The shower was hot and wonderful and the bed/linens so comfy. The best part though was the food. A chicken tangine bathed with honey, dates and apples. The lightest fluffiest couscous. Delicious. In hindsight, the best food I ate in all of Morocco! The following morning we had the most yummy breakfast. We did not want to leave. Jean and Martine are marvellous hosts. I look forward to a return trip when we can take advantage of the beautiful pool and deck.",4.0
"We only stayed in Dar Begui one night but wished it had been longer.  The hosts are so welcoming and helpful and the place is beautiful. The rooms are very tastefully decorated with lovely furniture and ornaments and are nice and spacious.  There is a FANTASTIC pool where you can have a really good swim and you will need to -Ouarzazate gets very hot. There is also a lovely terrace to sit at dusk, with views over the mountains and the city. We did not eat here but we saw someone else having dinner and wished we had done - it looked really good, and they serve a good selection of wine etc at very reasonable prices.  We had to leave at 6.30 am so unfortunately missed breakfast but the hosts left us out some cakes and fruit and arranged a taxi for us.  Dar Begui is about a 10 minute…",5.0

"Our hosts, Martine and Jean Michel, were as charming and gracious as any hosts can be. When we had trouble finding the B&B, Jean Michel drove over to lead us in. The atmosphere is relaxed and quiet. We slept late -- unusual for us. The rooms are simple, but spacious and attractive. We needed heat, and the wall unit was under our remote control and was very effective. Breakfasts are plentiful and delicious. Our dinner was classic Moroccan cuisine and was very good. The B&B is a new addition on an old building. The work is still in progress and will make this lodging even more comfortable. It's just a few kilometers to the Atlas Studios.",4.0
"My boyfriend and I booked to stay in Dar Bergui for three nights. We arranged everything via email before our trip which was very easy.  We arrived in Ouarzazate via a CMT bus and from the CMT bus station it cost about 20 dir to travel to the Riad in a petite taxi.  The riad is beautiful. There is a large courtyard which contains a swimming pool and sun loungers. Surrounding the swimming pool are the bedrooms. We had a double bedroom which was large in size and included an ensuite bathroom. Our stay was exceptionally comfortable, the hosts hospitable and the breakfast was a feast.  I would definitely recommend staying here during a visit to Ouarzazate and the surrounding areas.",5.0
"We spent just one night at Dar Bergui as we were only passing through, but it was great. We were the only guests and had the huge pool to ourselves after enjoying the view and the sunbeds for a couple of hours. The room was very spacious and tastefully decorated, the shower and bathroom were great, and there was parking right in front of the guest house on a quiet lane.  The owners were lovely and very friendly and helpful, and the food was fantastic. We had dinner and breakfast there and rolled out of the door to our car.",5.0
Staying in Kasbah El Mehdaoui was definitely one of the highlights of our trip to Morocco. Madame Najate and Mohamed were super friendly and great hosts. The dinner was the best we had in Morocco. Cannot recommend enough!,5.0
"Kasbah El Mehdaoie was a shot in the dark for us, and boy were we glad we chose to stay here! We needed a stop between Marrakech and Merzouga (for the desert) and were looking for affordable housing options. We thought staying in Skoura instead of Ouarzazate would give us at least an hour headstart to Merzouga - so we did a quick search of hotels in the area. We were deciding between El Mehdaoie and a more ""standard"" hotel along the main road. And El Mehdaoie stood out to us because we wanted to experience what it was like staying in a Kasbah (traditional Merchant house). We booked it the day of but forgot to inform the hosts that we were arriving late in the night. When we arrived, we woke the owner - she was kind and generous and invited us in - and said we will sort out all the bookings tomorrow. The room was simple but comfortable -- it had a system for both heat and air conditioning (which is a shocker for me, because i don't even have central heat/air back in the US). The bed was comfortable and I slept through the night.  The Kashah overlooks the river - we woke up to sounds of birds tweeting and the river flowing. We highly recommend walking down to and along the river at sunrise. When we returned from our walk, the hosts had prepared a whole table full of breakfast items in the Salon -- Moroccan baked eggs, breads, smoothie, coffee, moroccan tea, and more! The lady owner was a great cook, i have to say! Mohammed was kind enough to show us the rest of the place and share with us the history of the Kasbah (super interesting!). We didn't have a chance to use the pool, but the whole place is much larger than it seems on pictures of from the outside. I strongly believe this place is underrated - and highly recommend it to any travellers who are willing to take the short ride from the main road for a truly authentic Moroccan hospitality.…",5.0
The kasbah was just amazing! We arrived very late but that was no problem such a warm hospitality. The rooms are very clean and the kasbah is beautiful and still authentic. Beside that the homemade food and area are just breathtaking!   It was een bumpy ride but totally worth it ❤️ only good vibes   ,5.0
"After a bumpy drive to get there we arrived at the most beautiful spot on the river and an extremely warm welcome from the hosts. The food was hearty and very tasty, the rooms simple but clean and our short stay was really an experience; highly recommended for an off-road Kasbah experience. Make sure you go for a walk at dusk or early morning; the surrounds are magic. ",4.0
"Madame Najate and Mohamed were very welcoming and gracious hosts and make a great team together. The room was clean and comfortable and the food prepared by Madame Najate was tasty, wholesome with very generous portions. The drive to and from the village was a bit tricky due to roadworks and a detour but Mohammed was especially helpful and went out of his way to make things easier for us. Breakfast was wonderful with mostly home-produced food. Thanks to our hosts, our stay was a great introduction to Moroccan Berber culture and language which became one of the highlights of our trip to Morocco. A big thanks to you both.We love that you are very proud of your Berber heritage and culture and that you were so generous and energetic with sharing your language with us. You started something special for us and we enjoyed speaking a few words of your language for the rest of our trip.

"Dar Farhana is one of the best hospitality experiences I ever had in my life, and I travel a lot. The Riad is owned by a charming family who will treat you like family, thanks Ouarda, Ibrahim and Karim!. The riad is spotlessly clean, tastefully decorated, very comfortable, peaceful and the swimming pool is sooooo beautiful and inviting. The breakfast is delicious. All my needs and requests were met with a smile and understanding, they speak French and English fluently (and probably other languages too). They also assigned their wonderful receptionist Ayoub to guide me on a memorable afternoon excursion to a desert oasis he knew well, thanks Ayoub, you are the greatest. The riad is a few minutes ride from the center. If you have a car + gps, it will be easy to find and there are a few signs to show the way as you approach the street. If you don't have a car, they will send a driver to pick you up from the town at their own expense. I will return  to this wonderful place in the future. …",5.0
"This is the most hospitable place I have ever stayed. The staff is wonderful and Ouarda is extremely helpful and accommodating. The food is fresh and they provide you with everything you need to be comfortable. I slept so well here after traveling for over one month. The garden and courtyard area is so lovely.  I was having difficulties booking my flight from here to Casablanca online, and Ouarda did everything she could to help me, including taking me into town to convert my cash and then to the airport so that I could book directly with the airline there. I am so grateful to have chosen this sweet Riad and highly recommend anyone stay here if they’re staying in Ouarzazate. These people treat you like family and are so pleasant.",5.0

Members of the owners family can also help out with taxi service",5.0
"We can't stop dreaming about our time in Ouarzazate and the Dar Farhana. Our family really fell in love with this place and we will for sure be back - hopefully soon. The rooms, the pool area, the food, the owners - everything was just perfect. We had a warm welcome and a great dinner the first night. Because of that we changed our plans for the upcoming days and cancelled our accomodation in Zagora after one night. We returned to Ouarzazate to have more time at Dar Farhana and it was the best decision ever. Everybody was so nice and warm hearted, we felt like we were at home. They loved our kids, too. Thanks so much to Karim and his family for everything! Eda, Tobi, Levi and Iva",5.0

"Such a great stay!  This place can be a little hard to find but follow the signs and you’ll be just fine.  Ibrahim greeted us upon arrival with tea, coffee and cookies - much needed after a long drive.  We sat by the pool and rested a bit while Ibrahim confirmed our room.  We had hoped for dinner and were pleasantly surprised with what was an amazing meal.  Breakfast the next morning was just awesome as well.  Our room was on the main level right outside the lobby and parlor and had the potential to be pretty noisy.  But it all worked out just great - no complaints at all.  Totally recommend this place but just expect to be a bit away from the city center.",5.0
"We have spent one night at this property on April, the owner didn’t speak English very well, so we have problem to communicate with him, and the price was very expensive as for the city. Furthermore, the house is very far from the city center and difficult to find so if you don’t have a car do not come. When we want to pay by credit card they add 3% fee to total price. It was the worst experience in the south of Morocco. I don’t recommend this property at all",1.0

It was dark after we'd arrived with our excellent guide, Hassan Gabsi (you can find my review of him in the Travel Forum), who had lined up the lodging on our private trip for our family of 4.

Every little detail inside the house is thoroughly thought through and the hosts are always there to make you feel at home. In fact Dar Farhana means “Happy house”. All rooms have air condition, which was very helpful in the heat of the summer. So was the swimming pool, just next to the stunning garden with it’s many flowers and fruits, where you can have your breakfast or just sit and relax.

We were met immediately by the front of house Idris (and the beautiful dog Nelson!), making us so comfortable and just settled us in rather than worrying about check in admin; wonderful after a long drive.   After showing us to our room (gorgeous) and the grounds we were sorted with some drinks and pool time (a fantastic infinity pool!).   Throughout the stay the whole team was so attentive, nothing was too much trouble. Nothing could have epitomised this more than catching us before we drove away to help us out when our car had 1 flat tyre and a flat spare; getting extra tools and pointing us to a nearby mechanic.  I would recommend this hotel to everyone if you are travelling near Ouazazarte!",5.0

I was traveling with a friend and we had been non-stop moving (Casablanca/Rabat to Fes to the Sahara Desert) and this was a stop before we headed to Marrakech. It was really peaceful here, quiet, but just what we needed after a very jam packed few days. The hotel has an infinity pool, which was beautiful as you watch the sunset. It was a little too cold for me to get in, but my friend did for the Instagram.  It sounds like they are operated at least partially by solar panels, so the water took a little bit of time to warm up, which was fine by me anyways and good for the environment!  There's not a lot of dinner options nearby, so we had dinner here, which was really good! They even grow their own rosemary in their garden, which is then used to cook with.   The BEST part was the staff. We only met Christian, the owner at check-in and then we didn't see him until the end at check-out. There was another guy we interacted with the most and he was super friendly. He even recommended us a dinner spot in Marrakech (Dar Moha), which turned out great.   This is definitely not the most 'luxury' hotel in Morocco, but I thought for the price and what it had to offer, it was really good and I would definitely recommend.…",5.0

The owner Christian could have been more gratuitous. He had us fill out our own paperwork showed us our room and then never saw him till check out. He insisted the bill would be 5% more to use our credit card!   Run a business absorb the cost! We asked for a double and were given and charged for a triple. The sheets were scratchy and the doors did not open and close smoothly. A little more tlc and this place could be great.  The dinner was fantastic. Breakfast was too basic. For these prices we should have been served a hot breakfast.  If I were to advise I would say to look elsewhere.,3.0
"I want to give this hotel three stars for the following: wonderfully pleasant manager, incredible location overlooking a reservoir outside of Ouarzazate, and the Berber omelet we were served with our dinner. Yes, the rooms are a little dated, but the biggest downside for us was our encounter with a man we presume to be the owner. We had a small cooler we traveled with so we could have a cold beer at lunch or upon arrival to our hotel if it did not serve alcohol. This man intercepted our driver when he attempted to unload it and explained that he has a liquor license and so would not permit the cooler on the premises. Fair enough—I guess—but in all my travels I cannot recall a hotel ever searching our bags or preventing us from bringing our own refreshments or snacks to our room. And he was not polite about it, which really bothered my husband. Our driver said something to the effect that it’s not such a big deal and good to have happy guests, to which the owner replied, “I don’t care what the guests or their drivers think. I only care about the booking agent!” He really said that. Maybe this is why we were the only guests there that night even though it is the high season (that, by the way, also felt weird). He was only the second person we encountered on our entire 10 days in Morroco who did not exhibit the warm, welcoming hospitality of the Morrocan people. I think there must be better options in Ouarzazate...…",3.0
"We spent one night at this property, chosen for us by our tour company.  While the owner was very gracious, our particular room was not the cleanest and the shower plumbing had severe problems. Our dinner was outstanding; breakfast was skimpy. I'm not sure what other options are in Ouarzazate but it would be worth the time to look further before stopping here.",3.0
"Coming from Erg Chebbi dunes this was an amazing place to stop for the night. A guest house on the outskirts of Ouarzazate overlooking Lake El Mansour Eddahbi and fed by the waters from River Dades, River Draa and other secondary rivers. The location was little difficult to find as it is not clearly signed posted and it is surrounded by large Villas dotted around the lake. The view from the terrace was breath-taking with infinity swimming pool overlooking the lake. It was particularly windy on the day we arrived so did not get to use the pool. We had two rooms booked and both were nicely decorated with large spacious rooms and a private little terrace, massive bed and seating area and excellent aircon. There is a fast WIFI connection both in bedrooms and outside on the terrace. Idriss manager of Les Tourmalines made our stay very comfortable and welcoming. He is an excellent, very approachable host always smiling, full of enthusiasm and radiating joy and went beyond the call of duty to ensure we had a good stay. Idriss was able to tell us a lot about the local area and answered all our questions. The owners were away in Australia and Idriss ensured that the place was impeccable. We did meet Nelson the family dog and stroked him the next morning. Nelson was keener to leave the compound and run around! We had a beautiful dinner in an outside tent but as you enter it is a very solid structure and had windows that open out to the lake. We had different food tastes and Idriss was able to satisfy all of us. The Kitchen also prepared a special meal for my vegan daughter. There is a large vine selection to make your evening special. We seemed to be the only guests that night and under the full attention of Idriss. It was quite clear Idriss loves his job and this place. Breakfast was out on the terrace and there was plentiful to eat and very nicely laid out.  This place is beautiful, and you do need a car to get here, it is about half an hour’s drive from the centre of Ouarzazate. If you need peace and quiet and let your hair down from the heat of the day, then this is the place for you.…",5.0
"A beautiful setting overlooking a huge lake. Very good staff, food and an infinity swimming pool and one of the best places to stop off. Very good food and very quiet and peaceful. The resort is just off the N10 about 20k from the town of Ouarzazate. The manager is excellent and full of local knowledge. The nearby walled town of Ouarzazate has a market which much cheaper than Marrakesh and a great place to buy saffron from. A good stopping off point if you are driving from Agadir heading to the deserts at Mouzuga. The place is owned by a French couple Damienne and Christian who have a huge friendly dog.",5.0
We only stayed here one night and it was incredible. The dinner is a set menu and was wonderful because they accommodated my wife's vegetarian preference. The hotel was so peaceful next to the lake and wish we could have stayed here longer!,5.0
"We turned up on motorbikes on a wet, dark evening with no booking and were made to feel very welcome.  The rooms were really lovely. Very clean, great aircon, comfortable beds, super bathroom. Price was 965 MAD, the dearest we’d paid anywhere so far. But the hotel definitely had extra services offered (like the pool) to justify it.  Everywhere was nicely decorated and I wish we’d arrived early enough to use the swimming pool. It was stunning with a backdrop to match! We ate in the hotel restaurant and enjoyed the set menu of soup, brochettes and ice cream. Quite pricey at 200 MAD per person, but tasted good.  And they sell BEER!!  Not that I drink it, but my OH was very happy :-) Breakfast was really good too. Served on the poolside terrace.  Hotel location was approx 20 minutes from Ouarzazate, with very little around and poor signage.  But worth the effort to find it!…",5.0
"We are a couple in our early thirties and stayed in the hotel for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon in Morocco.   The hotel was meant to close for holidays but decided to stay open just for us (they knew we were in our honeymoon) - I have never seen this in my life.   The place is absolutely charming, the views to the lake are breathtaking, the food delicious, the rooms quite big and comfy.  However, an impeccable service is what makes a hotel different, and Driss made our stay unforgettable.

"We stopped here for one night on our way back from our night in the desert.   It is quite a way from the main town which makes it quiet and relaxing.   The pool is brilliant and seems to merge with the large lake in front, taking in all the views.  My room was on the side and was very comfortable and had everything I needed.  My cousin and I eat in the hotel and the food was very good especially the kebabs as was my beef tagine.  Breakfast in the morning was served outside on the terrace by the pool and was also very good and plenty of it.

"We have been there several times with family and friends and this is the go-to place whenever we travel in the region. We usually take our groups to Tourmalines as well and they have all loved the place so far.  It is hard to point out one single highlight. The hotel is ideally located right at the lake and offers stunning views, including the sunset over the lake in winter. The breakfast under the shade by the pool is an absolute blast. There is free wifi with actual working connection (not always the case in Morocco) and a separate lounge room with a cosy fireplace and bar for colder winter nights. Food is excellent and you have the possibility to select your meal way before dinner. The hotel serves alcohol as well and they allow pets which is again a rarity in the country. …",5.0
"As soon as you enter, we were welcomed by a vibrant and hospitable manager, Driss.  Beautiful view from the pool area, overlooking the reservoir. It was however very cold to swim in. The room was simple and the cleanliness average. The hotel is quite isolated and so there will be no dinner options unless you have a car (which we didn't). Our dinner consisted of a Berber omelette which was okay, the beef skewers were succulent and the dessert (3 flavours of ice cream) was not outstanding. Overall we would visit the place  again  for the breathtaking views and the hospitality of Driss. Thanks for making our stay enjoyable!! ",3.0

It really is the most stunning location; I am currently living in Morocco, and not aware of anything remotely like it anywhere else in the country. The views over the lake are breathtaking, and so soothing in hectic Morocco. Gin and tonics on the poolside patio as the sun sets before dinner, are a must!   The rooms are spacious and clean, dinner and breakfast were tasty and plentiful, and the pool is large. Last but not least, the hosts are absolutely lovely; both the French owners Christian and Damienne, and the Moroccan manager Driss. So warm, helpful, and informative.  Highly recommended!!",5.0

We spent two nights and had two very good dinners in the permanent berber tent set up by the pool.

Food was great and staff very friendly and helpful! The place is owned by a French couple so you are in good hands! We even got a wedding gift!  If you want to visit the area you can go to Ouarzazate but if you want to visit Ait Ben Haddou of the gorges you have to be willingly to drive a vertaling distance.

The meals were delightful.  The owners were helpful and pleasant.  The view over the reservoir was nice too.  However, we were counting on swimming in the pool but couldn't because the water was too cold owing mostly to a steady breeze that literally blew away the heat--and the air temperature was lower than normal.  But we think the hotel should have invested in a plastic cover that could be rolled over the top at night to keep the heat in, since there's really nothing much to do there except sit and look at the pool, the reservoir and the mountains in the district--and read a book.…",4.0

The guesthouse is such a beautiful location -overlooking the lake...absolutely breathtaking...great backdrop when you eat your meals on the patio by the infinity pool.

"From the heat of the edge of the Sahara, to the cool tranquility of Les Tourmalines - it's difficult to describe, but the beauty is astounding! Situated on the edge of a 22-mile ""lake"" the scene is breathtaking, the owners are welcoming and the service was good. I only stayed there one night, but it was a very good night in a good bed after good food. The French owner doesn't speak much English, but burst into renditions of Johnny Clegg and Savuka when he found out I was from South Africa. The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed, with the owner's dog Leon putting in frequent appearances. The perfect place to stop en route to the Sahara!",4.0
"Les Tourmalines is owned and operated by a French couple who reside above a selection of qute comfortable rooms.  On the shore of an artificial lake, and with an infinity pool and well-tended gardens, it is a good choice for a relaxation break on a tour of Morocco.  Food was good, but portions were a bit small and breakfast rather meager.  Enconomizing?  I believe so, as the room also contained a notice advising guests to turn off lights and ac when tey leave the room, supposedly because of the cost of energy.  Well, how aout the cost of the room? Not exactly cheap! This hotel is only an option if you have your own transportation, as there is none available on the premises, which lie roughly 20km outside Ouarzazate.",4.0
"We just returned from a week in Morocco, and stayed for two nights at Les Tourmalines as an escape from Marrakech and to see some countryside.  It was very quiet when we were there (only one other room occupied) but I gather this is usual for the low season.  Unfortunately it was too cold to use the pool, which is gorgeous looking across the lake.  The rooms are comfortable, but not flashy. The decor could use a refresh, but rooms are spacious and clean - so absolutely fine. But lacking the traditional character of the nice riads in Marrakech.  Good value for money overall. The landscaping and scenery are fantastic, and we were pleased to stay outside of Ouzarate (which is not a very picturesque town!)  Nice friendly staff too.

"I stayed at Les Tourmalines for two nights with a desert trek in the middle.   This hotel/ Maison d'hote is fantastic, a real hidden treasure.

The rooms are spacious and clean. (and the beds are large and very comfy).   The location of this gem is also ideal. It has amazing views that I could enjoy either from my room or from my personal terrace... Breakfast is also outside with the amazing views. The lake breathes silence and so does the hotel.

Tucked in in a forgotten and deserted area far away from ""downtown"" (it's NOT just 2 km, unless you're a bird...) it felt neither safe nor secure. Carpets and table cloths where dirty, the bathroom floor was wet (all the time) and there is a dirty broken SHOWER in the lobby?!? The terrace could have been nice if you could see the view, but unless you're two meters tall it-s impossible to look out. When we booked we were also told that there would be a private balcony, which there wasn't.   I can't believe how this hotel got such high ratings at Booking - it's shabby, dirty, dark and cold.

Well maintained grounds with extensive lighting and lovely trees that I loved to identify on my app. Several honeymooners (or couples seriously in love).

"We stayed in one of the Villas here for one night.   The villa itself could only be described as opulent.   It was huge, beautifully fitted out with a bar, library, pool table, kitchen (for the live in maid), sitting rooms with fantastic views, well maintained gardens, the bedrooms and bathrooms were big, clean and very comfortable, but there were a few drawbacks.   Firstly, the villa was some 700 metres from the clubroom/restaurant/reception so to go to and from your room you had to rely on the staff from the hotel to drive you to and from.   The TV in the rooms did not work and the hotel itself was quite some distance from the town of Ouarzazate which meant that if you didn't have a car you were stuck there.   All the villas at the club were spread out around a huge site that gave the impression that it was an unfinished development (there were indeed some unfinished villas that appeared to be abandoned) which meant that visiting friends in another villa would involve a very long walk.   The food at the restaurant was very nice and the service provided by all of the staff was great.   It would be a great place to stay if you just wanted to stay in your villa and relax for a few days.…",5.0
"This 'resort' appears to be a failed development.  There are a number of buildings that are attractive from the outside, some empty, and no golf course!  My room was dimly lit, worn and a bit shabby.  The grounds are attractive.  The building housing the restaurant is up-to-date and functioned well.  Breakfast was ok as was dinner.",2.0

We stayed 2 nights at this oasis beautifully cared for gardens and lawns. Lovely staff and views over the lake.  A late afternoon swim a read by the pool and then sunset drinks made this a lovely spot on our journey. The rooms are huge and lavishly appointed although the in room wifi was pretty useless.  Certainly recommend to anyone looking for a bit of luxury with lovely dinners on the deck overlooking the lake. ,4.0
"We had travelled from the desert and were looking forward to our stay at Hotel Sultana Royal Golf. I guess we could have done our homework a little better as this was not the golf resort we expected. There is a 9-hole golf course but it dried up long ago! The hotel is perched high above a drought-affected lake but the beautiful views remain. The hotel dining and service is delightful in either a very green garden setting, or on one of the hotel's terraces. Reception and wait staff were efficient and friendly and really made us feel welcome.

The owner , a French woman and her two daughters said hello to guests at dinner time.   A good wine list, and dinner was a mix of French, Italian and Moroccan.  probably not your traditional morocco stay, if you are expecting to stay in a riad or Kasbah this isn't for you.",4.0
"Beautiful, tranquil and amazing service.  Admittedly, we never fell in love with Morocco after some intense days in Marrakech. We fled East to visit the desert and got a great offer of this resort like place in the middle of absolutely nothing. And let's be honest: We couldn't have had a better stay.  The staff were friendly and joking, we loved the food, the pool was cold as hell (winter time), but beautiful and even though there's no real golf (only minigolf), they had pentanque and tabletennis if we got bored.  The rooms are a chapter of their own: We lived in the turquoise room and wow - it was huge and VERY turquoise.

"The hotel is run by a charming French lady named Véronique. She managed to build up this hotel in a picturesque landscape, overlooking a lake to the south and the Atlas Mountains off in a distance to the North. The gardens and the swimming pool turn it into a nice little oasis. Having been the only guests, we got the royal treatment with her delightful Moroccan employees, Tarik and Said.  The hotel consists of two buildings, each one of which has four rooms. Every room has a different color of walls. What I liked about the room, is that it had two beds and was rather spacious. During our stay, it was rather cold in Morocco and despite the fact that it has a heater/aircon installed, it didn't manage to really heat up the big room.    One top tip I need to give you is: don't try…",4.0

We were sent to the dependance, a private guesthouse (Rose Palace) which is 3 min driving away and which has its own infinity pool overlooking the barrage de Mansour (Mansour lake) . Unfortunately the room assigned (Ocean Room) was spacious but had only 2 Queen beds which was too small for 4, but the great Moroccon house guard Barra immediately brought an additional bed for us so everything was okay. The house was furnished like a private palace with seating and living areas everywhere so you felt more like being in a private house than in a hotel.

My mattress was very hard but that is not uncommon in Morocco, It was great to have a bar fridge in the room and air con was up to speed as was hot water and water pressure. Internet just OK.  Setting is really amazing as there is a view of a very blue green lake and lush gardens surround hotel buildings. At night these are lit up with multiple lanterns which was so so pretty.

I stayed with my family 1 night at the end of december. Yes this hotel is in the middle of nowhere and you need a car to get there. But it is in a truly beautiful setting. The scenery around is stunning. The golf course closed in 2009 and there are some abandoned houses around which looks a bit weird. The bedrooms are comfortable (beds are hard like everywhere in Morocco). The staff is very friendly and prepares delicious tasty dinner and breakfast. The view from the restaurant is also beautiful. It is a magic place in the Atlas plateau.,5.0

Really nice owner and staff in the restaurant and around the small resort. Waiters are very engaging and enjoy conversation with guests.

"We visited this hotel as part of a 2 weeks holiday in Morocco with my wife and my 3.5 years old daughter. We arrived at this hotel coming from Marrakesh. The hotel is a good 20 minutes' drive from Ouarzazate. There is nothing else around other than few villas, most of them uncompleted. The location is a bit ""ghosty""; the golf course inexistent as it dried up few years before because of the lack of water (rain). Despite that, the location is truly fascinating and beautiful; an oasis of style where you would not expect it. The staff and the owner are very friendly and the service is good.

Breakfast was also very nice and served on the lovely terrace overlooking the region.…",5.0
"We decided to book this place as a one-night luxurious break right after leaving the desert. It was a mistake. We had seen that it was outside of the city when booking it but we had no idea we'd have to pay 300 Dirhams (about 30 Euros) to get there and back. Petits taxis in Ouarzazate (the ""normal"" small ones) are not allowed to go that far so you have to hire a whole grand taxi, which is going to charge you at least 150 Dh each way. For backpackers on a budget, it was a big hit! However, once we got there, we did enjoy our stay.  The hotel grounds are sublime and our room was perfect. We were most excited about the corner bath tub, which was the main reason we booked this hotel in the first place.

Both the manager and the chef did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable. The room was comfortable, food tasty and breakfast on the roof terrace spectacular. If you want to be in the middle of nowhere, then this is the place for you. When we stayed, there were not many guests, combining this with the deserted location, it felt a lonely place!",4.0

The highlight is the pool area. There are about 8 rooms all build around the pool. The rooms are OK but you can tell they were build with a budget in mind. It lacks of the attention to details that you notice on a five star or even a four star hotel.  Another surprise for us is that there was nobody else at the hotel.

You would think there would not be much choice, but the menu is diverse and the food great topped by amazing presentation. The hotel room decor is 'out there' but fun. The planned golf course did not work because of the salt content in the water, but we were not there for golf. It was a great stop along our travels.",4.0
"At first it seemed a little unsettling that this hotel was located so far from Ouarzazate center, but the remote location next to a beautiful lake surrounded by snow-capped mountains made this fine hotel one of favorites in Morocco.   My family and I were fortunate enough to drive up to the Sultana Royal after the sun had set. Our guide insisted we missed a glorious sunset view, but I was grateful we didn't miss this fabulous hotel shining in the dark. It was lit up with dozens of elegant Moroccan-style garden lanterns. It was a beacon of comfort and warmth after a long day of traveling.   The rooms were exquisite. My aunt found the shower to be a little difficult to maneuver, and the televisions were impossible to figure out, but overall, it was a splendid experience.  We ate…",5.0
"but excellent grounds, service and value nonetheless. We also sampled the restaurant for dinner and were pleasantly surprised by the assortment of continental and moroccan options. Breakfast was plentiful with an assortment of local cheeses. Although the room decor may not be for everyone -is it ever?- the location, pool, views, and the hands-on attention of the owners, a retired French couple, made this place an excellent respite in the middle of the desert.",5.0
"Me and my husband went to Morocco last week to spend a 1 week... just after we were retourning from a trip to the desert, in the middle of the road back to Ourzazate, we found this PERFECT PLACE! An amazing luxurous oasis for a very good price. Not only the location is speechless, but also the ""monsieur"" who received us was extraordinarely nice and attentive. We just had the perfect time we were looking for the end of our trip. I would recomend it to everyone, even perhaps flying to Ourzazate just to see the place. The restaurante is also excellent and the swimming pool absolutely beautiful.",5.0
"Breathtaking landscape, eccellent location, good french, italian and local food, the Hotel is running by an efficient and smart French couple.

"The location is perfect in a calm surrounding and the service is so nice wether in the luxurious restaurant or at the hotel. I had wonderful moments at the bar and the views are magical. The restaurant offers a large choice from the international cuisine to the typically local one. For all my fellow travelers, the rooms are wide enough with beautiful furniture and the whole complex is clean. I was astonished by the view that you discover at the fitness club, absolutely charming. A must see place !!",5.0
"A group of 7 of us stayed at the Sultana on our way to and from Mergoza.  We were given an entire building to ourselves so we could spread out in three rooms.

This is a must for every connoisseur of decadence and comfort. We stayed at the beautiful palais des roses on the very edge of the lakes. Stupendous views and amazing hospitality for us and our little dog. The food is overseen by Veronique and is exactly what you would expect from a first class French kitchen. Breakfast served on the terrace overlooking the lake topped off a first class stay.,5.0

"A last minute substitution by our trip organiser, I must admit we felt a bit out of place in this very upmarket resort where apparently the King of Morocco has been known to stay. The owners greeted all guests personally and was most charming, and the food in the cinema-themed restaurant was excellent without being pretentious. Only downside was the internal decor of the rooms which was the epitome of 'more money than taste'  IMO - overdone clashing colours and trilobite infested marble washbasin. Would not recommend only because the friends I know would hate it.",4.0
"If you can stay here, please do! It is the best place in the area of Ourzazate. It is beatifully situated near Skoura, near the big lake. It has very spacey, luxury rooms with an awsum bathroom for only €75 -80!!!!  Veronique and the staff are very friendly, the restaurant is beautiful and nicely priced too.  Merci beaucoup Veronique!

I stay in this hotel with some friends. The location is perfect with a great view. You can easily  go to ourzazate (is there something interesting to visit there??). We where going to the desert from marrakech and it was the perfect stop. The pool and gardens are great. The food is fantastic! The rooms are huge with a very kitsch decoration (bad Vercace...) but nice to stay and comfortable.  The owners (a couple of french) are very very nice and looked very chick in the middle of the atlas desert () It was part of the glamour of staying there. Thank you! Rui,5.0
"We just left Riad Tama, one night stay on a tour.  The place is beautiful inside, nice pool with small fountains all around.  The rooms were uniquely decorated, made you feel you were immersed in Morocco.  Food was excellent, and large portions.  Beds were very comfortable, and lots of pressure in the shower.  Hosts are very friendly, and helpful.  Had a great time here, hope to come back",5.0
"Definitely a hit with my sister and me. Located on the outskirts of Ouarzazate it’s a typical riad  only in that the outside of the building doesn’t represent the inside. Tastefully decorated and well appointed, the owners have thought this out well. Supper was the best I experienced in Morocco. Cudos to the chef! The staff were very helpful, pleasant and spoke English well. I have only two things that didn’t quite work for me. The first is that our tour only spent one night here. I feel it deserves at least 2 nights so that you can relax in luxury and check out some of the spa options the riad offers. The second is that the water pressure in the room I was in was a bit lacking but I was able to get showered. It was very clean with enough plug ins to charge phones and tablets. They also provide a blow dryer. I would definitely stay here again.…",4.0
"We stayed here one night during our tour and could have easily stayed longer  The staff were so genuine and welcoming , They brought us mint tea as a welcome and our room was amazing  This is not an all mod cons hotel but a real taste of Morocco and we absolutely loved it  It was too cold to try the pool (April)  which was a shame but the whole Riad has a lovely feel to it. The evening meal in the restaurant was the best hotel food we had eaten during our whole trip and none of the other hotels we stayed in had served us poor food so that should tell you how good it was .  The staff were so friendly and wanted you to enjoy their hotel . The following morning the breakfast before we left was excellent including the cheese omelette  This was also the only hotel out of the 6 we stayed in that offered tea & coffee making facilities in our room another bonus…",5.0
"Stopped overnight. Staff were helpful. Dinner was included and was good. Room was comfortable. If I had stayed more nights probably wouldn't love it, but for a night on the way to Marrakech it was restful.",4.0
This hotel is very cute but I wouldn't say its location is excellent. We stayed as part of a tour and got to the hotel very late - this was a blessing as we were so tired we didn't even want to explore the surrounding area - which had very little. The rooms were all comfortable with nice bathrooms and they were all quiet. The city itself is a bit underwhelming. If you want to get use out of the Hammam steam room be sure to tell them well in advance as it takes a few hours to turn on and get going - we learned this the hard way.   There's a private pool which was nice but since it was February we got no use out of it.   Food at the hotel was excellent - every dish was delicious. Overall its a nice option but you won't be centrally located if you want to explore the city.,4.0
"We arrived late at night and the staff there went above and beyond to accommodate us. Excellent service! They greeted us with a table full of food, excellent food at that! The room was nice and spacious! Loved the pool which was also open all night - huge plus having been in the car most of the day! Love love love this place!!! Cannot wait to go back soon!",5.0
"On our adventure to Morocco, the tour provider selected the hotels.  Our twosome chose the lesser level of accomodations, rather than the superior.  Well, I have to say that those that stayed in the generic ""superior"" hotels missed out on this wonderful experience.  The Riad is set away from the main part of Quarzazate, and as we were approaching the location I had trepidations about the accomodations as it was off the beaten path.  However, what a wonderful surprise when we arrived.   The staff was extremely welcoming, and dinner was available almost before we got to settle in the room.  The food was outstanding and the accomodations were adequate and beautiful.   It turned out that we were the only guests in the riad, and in the morning we could look out our window and see our breakfast table already set for us.  I would highly recommend this place over generic hotel accomodations.…",5.0

"We were advised to come here and were not disappointed. The riad is simply beautiful, with its central pool and chilled places. The view on the palms and the surrounding mountains is lovely. Rooms are really comfortable and well equipped, everything you need is there. Most of all, the service and staff is perfect and so nice, the food is maybe the best we had in Morocco. We highly recommend it !!",5.0
"Located outside the city, this Riad was not ostentatious, but extremely comfortable and a very typical Moroccan style accommodation.  The staff was so attentive and charming and the food was superbe.  Outside the Riad, there is a lovely area to walk around, with beautiful birch trees and green area.",5.0
"One of the nicest places I have ever stayed...not a cookie cutter copy in a chain. We were greeted warmly upon arrival, served tea and cookies in the lovely courtyard as we filled out the requisite paperwork. The courtyard was stunning...lots of foliage. The interior was lovely and charming, adorned with cultural artefacts. The room was large...coffee available in room, spacious bathroom, comfortable bed. We could hear the morning call to prayer. Dinner was very good although there was no choice. As we discovered, few alcohol choices. Very satisfying brealfast. Staff were attentive. Cannot praise this riad enough. ",5.0
"We stayed here for just one night as part of our tour of the country.  The staff were very welcoming and offered us tea as soon as we arrived.  Our room was the best so far on our tour of the country with  a good shower, hairdryer, OK wifi.  Our dinner was a set meal of  soup, mixed meat tomato rice, then a caramel desert with nuts. All very nice. We had a really good night’s sleep and up at 0815 feeling refreshed. Breakfast was Moroccan style, bread, vegetables, yoghurt etc.  Overall a very nice stay.",4.0

Our room was spacious and comfortable. Beautiful courtyard with pool.",5.0

Rooms have glass doors and windows which is a little strange, but curtains to cover them for privacy. It’s a ways from the centre of town, but only a 4 minute drive from the Atlas film studio (if you have business there, this would be an ideal place to stay). My friends and I were able to observe the sunrise from the rooftop patio!",4.0

Our stop at Riad Tama was very enjoyable after spending many hours in the car.",5.0
"Very nice riad to stay in, quiet and the staff is very friendly. When travelling Morocco and staying in Ouarzazate I would definitely advise this riad for a stay. Surroundings of Ouarzazate are beautiful and there is enough to do in Ouarzazate.",4.0
"I was extremely disappointed by this riad because of all the other riads that we stayed at in Morocco (5 total, from Rabat to Marrakech), this was by far the worst! There were 22 people staying at this establishment, and on the night that we arrived at least two rooms had issues with their showers overflowing into the hallways. We went to bed that night after giving our shower a quick test and feeling pretty lucky that our shower did not appear to be leaking as with some of the other rooms. The next morning we woke up and found that NO hot water was available in our bathroom! We immediately informed the front desk of the issue only to find that other guests were having the same issue! NO HOT WATER!! The staff explained that the water is heated by solar power so that if there is…",1.0
"Nice riad on the edge of town. Nice views from the back, especially the rooftop (the roof patio and gardens on the ground floor were both nice). However, there wasn't much we could walk to just out the door. Didn't matter to us much, as were only there for a quick stay.  The dinner and breakfast were good - nothing too memorable, but perfectly acceptable.   Wifi/internet was fast. Room was comfortable and the mattress on the firm side (which I liked).  Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.",5.0
"While driving through a local village, you might want to make U turn, thinking of who will build a hotel at this place?!  Out of your surprise, you come to arrive at an amazing retreat. This is how I like about Morocco, it will surprise you, either you hate it or you will fall in love with it.   This hotel is not too big which is a GOOD & QUIET place for relax. The garden & patio are tastefully decorated. Look at the photos I have taken. Got up early in the morning, went up to the rooftop & be mesmerized by the sunrise, it’s so beautiful surrounding by the deserted landscape you can see miles away. The staffs are very friendly, room is very clean. To feel home, this is the place you wanted to be at. I will come again in end of November. ",5.0
Beautiful riad with excellent view of a garden and pool in the center.The staff was very helpful and kind. They gave us all of the essentials. Room and shower was clean and tastefully decorated.

"First the good news. Rooms are clean.   Now reality. Located in an isolated part of town. Difficult to get to a decent restaurant. No bottled water in rooms, lots of barking dogs, braying of donkeys.   Dinner came with our room. Started out with a pretty tasteless macaroni salad. Harissa made it pretty good. Next Cornish game hen that was so overcooked it could have substituted for a squash ball.   Did have a fairly good Moroccan wine, which helped to down the almost completely dehydrated game hen.   With the exception of Ryad Tama, every other place we have stayed the past two weeks has been wonderful. Not sure where the glowing reviews have come from, but scratch this from our list of properties worthy of a return visit.",2.0
"I had high expectations of this riad based both on the reviews and our previous experiences with comparable riads in Marrakech. What a disappointment!!! Yes, the management is nice, and the rooms are pleasant and clean. But our room stank of sewage, and when we opened the windows to eliminate the smell, flies poured in. They moved us to another room on a higher level, which improved the situation somewhat but did not entirely correct it. Perhaps it was a temporary situation and has since been resolved? I hope so — because it really did ruin our experience of Ouarzazate.",3.0
"Continuing in the peacefulness of the desert, this lovely Riad will not disappoint. The people at the Riad are there to help and make the experience memorable. Arriving at this place, one wonders what is about to appear because it is among unfinished buildings with not much surrounding the property. Open the doors and it is just wonderful with the lush plants and the beautiful swimming pool. It was a bit too cool to enjoy swimming but just the surroundings were peaceful. There are small farms all around the property that made for a wonderful place for a walk after a long drive. We had a fantastic dinner and breakfast all prepared on site. If you are planning a trip along the route thru Quarzazate Morocco, don't miss this wonderful place.",5.0
"Super clean with new rooms on the upper level as well as a lovely dinning room. The people are amazing and always attentive to your needs - Abyss in particular.  Food was great and plentiful, although on a last day to our surprise the breakfast orange juice was watered down!  Otherwise no complaints - well only one minor one; TV in the room didn't work.  A fridge in the room was also a pleasant surprise.",4.0

"The Riad Tama is of a very high standard and is very traditional with an indoor court yard.  The staff were great and gave us every assistance.   The lime trees were in fruit and so were the Pomegranates. Its the little things that make all the different. Food was outstanding and rooms very clean. The pool was great, we dipped our feet in after walking to the local ""Cinema Studio Atlas"" (a film studio). Make sure you bring bottles of water as its about 15 minutes walk and takes about an hour to look around. Would wholeheartedly recommend the Riad Tama.",5.0

However, having glass walls & glass doors all around means that when you require privacy, including when you use the toilet, you must remember to close a couple of curtains. Also, a bit far away from the town center, and so, if you feel like strolling in the city, it is just not possible, unless you have your own transport. But a decidedly classy riad.",4.0
"We travelled with a group of 16 and stayed here one night. The Riad appeared to have been a one storey building, but two new levels were being added. When we arrived, we were told we would have to wait 45 minutes before we could get into a room. We had mint tea and biscuits while we waited, which was probably for an hour. We soon discovered the reason for the delay. Most of the rooms for our group were on the first level and the builders were still finishing off the rooms! Construction on the top level continued late into the evening, although we were not disturbed. Most of us had brand new rooms, new beds and chairs, sheets blankets towels etc. There were some minor problems with hot water to rooms but this was quickly fixed by the builders who were on site.

Our room had great air conditioning and wifi, and the surrounding area is so peaceful. Right across from the Atlas studios and we were also able to go for afternoon runs through the plantations.

We are grateful for their hospitality, it was one of our travel's reference points. Andreea and Sabina",5.0
"Arrived at Riyad Tama after a long day of travel. Despite the unimpressive surrounding the hotel is well furbished inside. My room was large and comfortable. Had a 3 course dinner and food was very good, especially the dessert which was fruits in smoothie. Owner and staff were friendly and helpful.",5.0
"We recently stayed over night at the Riad Tama while on 9 day tour of Morocco.  Upon our arrival we were greeted by the most hospitable staff, who did everything in the power to see to our comfort while we were there.

"We booked two rooms at the Tama Riad and it was an amazing experience, the host were very accommodating to all are needs and very welcoming. The Riad itself has outstanding views with some beautiful walks to an oasis.  The rooms are perfectly decorated and have an very nice tiled shower in Moroccan theme. The food, both breakfast and dinner is second to none it was amazing and presented very nicely. Located in close proximity to numerous attractions including the film studios which are just 5mins walk from the Riad. Thank you ",5.0
"After a long day, we arrived in this Riad. We were welcomed very friendly with some tea. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The Riad was very cosy. Everywhere there were candles.

"We arrived at Tama after a long day trip, dusted and tired, only to discover a true oasis of relaxation, which changed our mood instantly. The design of the hotel is first class, showing true Morocco symbols and art. It has a swimming pool and a superb garden. We had the cleanest rooms so far in Morocco, everything with a fresh smell. Food was also excellent, I only wish i can get the recipe for the lamb dish...",5.0
"This place is truly special. It is out of the way, so a bit hard to find, but once you arrive and step inside--what a wonderful surprise! The furnishings are beautiful, the rooms meticulously clean, and if that were not enough, the service is incredibly friendly and out of this world. We unfortunately were only able to spend one night at this wonderful riad, but did have the opportunity to have both dinner and breakfast there. Neither meal disappointed. I highly recommend Riad Tama. It was my favorite out of a number of excellent riads we stayed at during our Moroccan visit.",5.0

"We arrived late at night after a long drive from the desert and drove through some backstreets before finding ourselves at the front door of this charming and authentic riad. Even though it was late, the staff held dinner for our very hungry family...cuisine was local and absolutely delicious. The rooms are both modern and traditional, with gorgeous carpets everywhere (the owner of Tama also owns a very special market of Moroccan artefacts which you should visit if you have a moment.) Staff at this riad were as friendly and as hospitable as you will find.",5.0
"I loved the entry, the authenticity but still modern look of this Riad. The rooms were very clean and beautifully decorated. Great bedding and cosy feeling. The bathroom with mosaic decoration was very pretty. The food Abdellah cooked was amazing and the garden peaceful and nice for the eyes with a view on the oasis. Definitely recommend this place!",5.0
I very much enjoyed my stay with a friend at Riad Tama. The service was outstanding and the people very caring. They cooked something light especially for me as I was suffering from a stomach ache and sent the headphones I had forgotten back to me. The atmosphere is just really nice and relaxing. It is very clean and has a charming atmosphere. And: Don't forget to book dinner at the Riad. It is lovely and prepared right on the spot.,5.0
"The staff here were the most friendly and hospitable that we had on the trip so far.   The location is out of the way in an area being developed. However the Riad is complete with a swimming pool, great size rooms and nice view of the valley. It has only been open a year which is why there aren’t many reviews.   Dinner was tasty but not as good as some other riads we stayed at. However it was perfectly ok and the chef made an alternative starter when requested due to food intolerance.  The room was clean and tidy and a good size. The communal garden and view of the valley made this a good stop over on our tour of Morrocco.    ",5.0
"This is a beautiful and quiet Read.  The staff go out of their way to make you feel appreciated and very welcome.  They even had a birthday part for one of the 6 guests there!

We made our attempt at the dancing! The best life has to offer!",5.0

It was the perfect place to relax in between, with a beautiful pool in the middle of the garden, large rooms with large bathrooms to match and amazing decor. The food was good as well (with a welcome break from tagine after a week!) and the staff was very nice :) ",5.0

But I got so well taken care of by the entire staff, I couldn't have asked for anything more! Mohammed, the manager, took me to a great doctor and translated everything he said for me since i don't speak a word of French. He then went with me and bought all my medicine. The amazing chef took so well care of me and cooked me food that my body could handle, and I was well after 2 days. The Riad in itself is a green calm oasis. It's situated next to a beautiful valley and has in my oponion the best views in Ouarzazate. The rooms are big and spacious and come with all the necessities you need, including great aircon. The decoration, food and the amazing pool…",5.0
I've stayed in Riad Tama with my friend and we were amazed with this Oasis!!! Its an amazing spot with a great location and with a breathtaking view of the Tamassine palms. The pool in the garden is just a dream. The people that work there are super friendly and the cook became my new BFF after the wonderful dinner we had underneath the stars!! The rooms are really confortable with a decoration I want to take home. I totally recommend this Riad for anyone looking where to stay in Ourzazate.,5.0
"Riad Tama is a paradise on earth: magic scenery,unbelievable Moroccan decoration with an elegant taste, major comfort and tranquility,the tastiest food ever and the most important: great level of hospitality and services from its personnel. I recommend it to all types of travellers 100% !!!!!!!",5.0
"   Riad Tama is the best place to stay in Quarzazate. It's a quit place near the centre and the best choice for somebody who wants to visit the desert during the day.     The staff was very kind and warm. The chef is the best. The girls who work there are always willing to please you and they are always smiling.      Our room was perfect. Big, clean, bright and it had all the necessities ( towels, hair dryer, shampoo and etc.)     Riad Tama is so traditional and beautiful-the architecture of the riad, it's colours, everything...-      The manager, Mohamed, was always willing to please us and help us with any of our questions and worries.      We definitely prefer this riad when we come back to Morocco.      Thank you for everything! ",5.0
"This Riad is the perfect getaway from the tiresome desert heat, chaos and dust! Beautifully decorated with lovely food and an inviting pool, we only stopped for lunch but wanted to stay forever! Staff were very friendly and accommodating with dietary requirements etc.  Would definitely go back and highly recommend!  ",5.0
Lovely relaxing serene riad with beautiful vieuws. The staf is very warm and welcoming so you will feel immediately at home. The rooms are beautiful decorated. The pool refreshing and surrounded by green. Special thanks to the cook! What a delicious food  served so stylish with embroided napkins.  For sure I can highly recommend this wonderful riad!,5.0
"This is easily one of the better meals we had on our trip to Morocco! We actually were only stopping by for lunch and quick cooling dip in the pool during our 9 hour drive from the Sahara back to Marrakech! If we had known of this place, we would have booked a stay! The location is secluded, and therefore peacefully serene. Gorgeous colors and decor inside the riad! We wanted goat tagine-- and while the owner originally said they didn't have it when our guide called to reserve a table last minute, they went out of their way to accommodate us and obtained goat meat for our meal! Exceptional service! I highly recommend!",5.0

She helped with expedition plans, took us in when we arrived un announced from the cancelled Rose Festival, She even called us to make sure we arrived safely in Marrakech. A million thanks! Highly recommended !",5.0
"This relatively new lodge is a real gem and such a relaxing place to stay for a few days after a grueling drive to Erg Chebbi and back. We had been driving around Morocco for nearly a month staying in all levels of accommodation, and this was one of the very best. We didn't have the dinners, so can't speak to that, but the breakfast was excellent, and owner Anne-Marie's recommended bottle of wine to enjoy by the pool was perfect. The lodge is well located on the outskirts of Ouarzazate, so that you can avoid the bustle of the city but easily drive in for dinner or to shop. The directions for getting to the lodge are a little daunting (""crossing a wasteland"" is in fact correct) and you think you must be headed to a hovel, but don't let that put you off. Faithfully follow…",5.0
"A beautifully landscaped property. A large, extremely comfortable and private bedroom complex.  My wife has a mobility issue and our meals (both breakfast and dinner) were served on our deck.  Food was excellent as was the service.  A great spot to relax and take a break from the daily touring.  Highly recommended. ",5.0
"We stayed here for 2 nights as part of a group holiday. It was wonderful. The family running the lodge were so welcoming. We loved our little bungalow which was beautifully decorated, spotless and comfortable. We had dinner both nights and the food was great. It's possible to explore the nearby oasis and discover how the local people live. Equally relaxing in the grounds in this part of Morocco is a treat.",5.0

Man.. the folks at this resort took care of us like family. Abdul was incredible and the food was delicious.. what was even better is the remote location of this lodge. We went on night drives and literally minutes away you are under the stars. The lodge is in the village so you get to see the way of life of the locals. The rooms were comfortable and simply beautiful built in the local architecture ,5.0
"The main draw/attraction of Skoura Lodge are the Burkina Faso inspired lodges, along with the quiet this remote stay provides. I'm sitting in the restaurant right now after a long day in the Gorge area. Imagine our surprise when the 3 lodges we booked weeks in advance were occupied by a large group that showed up the day before. The owner was fully aware of this conflict by midday and failed to inform us, providing nothing but empty apologies. Given the time left in the day, we had no time to make other overnight arrangements, let alone dinner. We were relegated to overflow rooms above the restaurant (see pics).   I don't yet know how the food tastes, but the experience has already left a bad taste in our mouths.  Find another place to stay. ",1.0
On the way to the Merzouga Desert we spent the night at Skoura Lodge. The accommodation is comfortable and clean. Excellent service and food.

"A comfortable and interesting stay in an “oasis” in the Palmery (green area) of Skoura.   The hotel is a hybrid of Moroccan life style with a real French Flair.  The hotel rooms are spacious and spread out on the grounds with all the amenities ... but with connecting rooms that you can hear you neighbours (not great if they are active all night as in our case).  The beds are a bit hard but comfortable.  The hotel has a farm on its grounds and produces local produce and soaps which is very special.  The dinner was good, but the breakfast simple (continental style).  The drive to the hotel was also most interesting through the village, dust roads, and a river bed ... you will not expect this hotel at the end of the trip.  It has a nice pool and grounds though ... which makes it…",3.0
This location is an amazing Moroccan oasis where you can find comfort and taste the real Moroccan culture. Rooms are comfortable and fancy. Dinner in the restaurant is amazing having the chance to taste different tajin and the breakfast is in perfect Maroccan style as well. You cannot leave without spending at least 1night in this place. Thanks guys for having take care of us!,5.0
"Wir waren versehentlich einen Tag zu früh da und standen vor verschlossenen Türen. Nach has einem Anruf kehrten innerhalb von 10 min 3 Mitarbeiter - extra für uns - aus ihrem freien Abend zurück und organisierten uns sogar noch die Küche damit wir ein Abendessen bekommen. Sehr freundlich, sehr zu vorkommend und unglaublich hilfsbereit.  Hätte einen sechsten Stern verdient.   We made a mistake in booking and arrived one day before our reservation. A call and ten minutes later, three men from the hotel came back from their ways home - just for us - it was their free evening! And they even organized us dinner! Very friendly, very helpful - just perfect service! We can highly recommend and would give a 6. star :)",5.0
"This place was an incredible find! We had some problems with a prepaid reservation in Ouarzazate (owner refused to honor our booking and wanted us to either leave or pay again) and decided to just get out of town and head towards Skoura.  It was about 9:30PM when we finally were able to get our money back from the website and get a new booking at another hotel. We were frustrated and just wanted a nice place to sleep. We just chose Skoura Lodge on a whim because it looked nice and clean online and advertised a late check-in. It turned out to be one of the best hotels during our 3-week trip.  Even at night, we had no problem finding the Lodge. There are plenty of signs pointing the way, just trust them and keep going.  Here’s how accommodating they were: When we arrived around…",5.0
This is a lovely lodge with excellent service. Abdul was a warm and gregarious host. Our accommodations (two separate cabins) were clean and well appointed and the food was excellent. We only stayed one night as it was a stop on our tour but if we had stayed in the region longer we would have gladly stayed here for more nights.,5.0
"My family spent 3 nights at Skoura Lodge and loved it. Beautiful deco and layout . Tranquil and serene in the out skirts of Skoura. We had some trouble finding it since we arrived at night and the GPS takes you to an incorrect spot. It is NOT in Ouarzazate - it is 20 minutes past it.  But our very kind and excellent host, Abdul, came out to the main road and lead us through the gravel unmarked unlit streets to the lodge.  But the remoteness is what makes it so serene. And we met there a local guide named Ismail Eddibi, who gave us a wonderful very personal tour of the fascinating oasis of Skoura. Ask the hotel to contact Ismail for you. I highly recommend Skoura Lodge for its beauty, good food and excellent pampering hospitality. ",5.0
"If you want to have a true Moroccan experience in "" The Door to the Dessert"" but stay in a gorgeous, unique, and accommodating hotel, come to Skoura Lodge. Many modern Moroccan cities are big, bustling, and intense, and it can be hard to fine a genuine Moroccan friend who truly wants to connect. But at Skoura Lodge nestled atop the beautiful Ouarzazat Oasis in ""The Door to The Desert"", you become part of a second family.   You will be inspired by the friendly and passionate Abdul and Ismail Eddibi who are so dedicated to their local culture as well as excited to meet new friends from all walks of life. They both speak many different languages including French, Spanish, English, Arabic, and Berber. It's quite rare to find anyone who can integrate modern life with an ancient…",5.0

There are some places that you simply fall in love with and this was one such place!! The kasbah is also a museum with one of the most funny and informative guide (Rida) who spoke 5 languages fluently! The restaurant in the hotel is exceptional and so is the accomodation. Incredible experience and a rare find. Definitely stop here .. off the beaten tourist path on you way to the sahara,5.0
"We were a group of 16 Italians coming from other places in Morocco where we were accommodated even in nice place but nothing to compare to Kasbah Amridil. Amazing place, like a castel, with simple but clean rooms, no complain at all. But the best had still to come as the dinner was definitely the best ever along our staying in Morocco and the welcome from all the staff was much more than a warm welcome. Reda, the manager of the place, gave to us useful information not only about our journey but also pleasantly talking with him regarding politics, economy, movies and whatever else interesting concerning Morocco. Last but not least, Reda the day of our leaving we had a deeply visit to the Kasbah, that I cannot what a nice experience was. Said that what more: I strongly suggest this place and invite you all to be a guest of the Kasbah.…",5.0
"We spent 2 weeks in Morocco around Christmas 2017 and of all the places we stayed at on the trip this kasbah was the most memorable! We drove from Marrakesh to Merzouga and this was our overnight stay on the road. We were the only guests that night, which totally added to the magic of the experience. Imagine you have your own sand castle? That's how it felt.   The actual kasbah is 300 years old, but very well preserved. It's an open air museum and a big tourist attraction in the area. So being able to stay here overnight was a real privilege. The hotel section is a new addition, so the room had heating and hot shower. There is an awesome roof patio, where I spent half a night photographing the stars.   The manager Mr. Reda was such an accommodating host! The night before we were supposed to arrive, he sent me driving instructions and offered to make a dinner (because the location is a bit away from the main town of Skoura and is far from restaurants). Once we arrived, he served the customary tea with locally grown dates and we ended up just chatting about life for a about couple of hours.  The breakfast spread was awesome too! With white buns, crepes, yogurt, cheese, jams, several types of olives... Overall, breakfasts in Morocco is my favourite thing!! Before getting back on the road, we went to visit the museum part of the kasbah. Again, this early in the day we were exploring it by ourselves, no other visitors in sight. So if you value independence and authenticity, I highly recommend staying at kasbah Amridil overnight.…",5.0
"We have just spent a night here with our three young children and I couldn't have hoped for a better place to stay. The manager, Reda, is such a welcoming, happy and gracious host and spent time explaining things, looking after us and playing with our children - even though his hotel had been taken over by a 600 strong film crew and he had a thousand other things on his plate. Our dinner was genuinely home made and the stuff of kings. The breakfast was magnificent. We loved this hotel and I hope we'll come back one day. Thank you Reda!",5.0
"We stayed three nights at Kasbah Amridil and we loved every minute of it. Here's why:  The kasbah is absolutely beautiful. It has an old and a newer part, both built the traditional way. The guest rooms are in the newer part and you can take a tour trough the old part and see how people have lived there in the 17th century. The kasbah situated in an oasis, with lots of palmtrees, fruittrees and olive trees. The landscape is quite picturesque. Every morning stepping out of my room I was amazed by the stunning landscape I was seeing. The food was very good as well. The breakfast was great and the dinners Réda's wife Amina cooked us were even greater. Réda was the best host you could wish for. Réda welcomed us warmly with Moroccan tea and salted peanuts when we arrived. He helped us planning our day trips and and showed us around in the old kasbah. He made absolutely sure we had everything we could wish for. Amina even washed my clothes as my suitcase had gone missing at the airport.  This place might even be our favourite place spending our holiday. Thanks Réda and Amina for the great time!…",5.0
We arrived in Skoura late at night however the staff were still happy to organise dinner for us. The room was clean and a fire was lit to heat up the water for the shower which was very authentic. Breakfast was good too.   Note there is only wifi in the main areas and we were the only people staying there! Also a little difficult to communicate with the staff if you don't speak French.,4.0
"Yes, this Kasbah-style hotel really does abut the 17th century Kasbah Amridil. We stayed in terrace room #9. Our queen-size mattress was a little hard for us, while the pillows were perfect. The ensuite was small but clean. The courtyard was delightful and the views from the hotel were lovely. Mr Reda was our gracious host and spoke good English. He and his wife are very friendly and the dinner and breakfast (included in the price) were both plentiful and delicious. I thoroughly recommend a stay at this hotel.",5.0
"We stayed with Reda and his wonderful family on the way to Merzouga...  It was a long drive from imlil and we arrived late but Reda waited for us and prepared a lovely meal!  The auberge is amazing it felt like we had finally arrived in the ancient morocco! The noise of the birds, the call to prayer and the view of the dried river bed and oasis in the distance.  We stayed for one night, walked around the old kasbah the next day which is joined and part of the B&B then made our way to the desert.  Thanks for a warm welcome and a great stay!",5.0
"My wife and I had a wonderful 1 night stay at Espace Kasbah Amridil.  We decided on staying at this unique hotel as we were making our way from Marrakech to the desert. The rooms are clean and very comfortable. The manager, Mr. Reda, is a wonderful man who really made us feel at home. He even gave us a highly entertaining personal tour of the Kasbah which is attached to the hotel. The home cooked meal that Mr Reda's wife prepared for dinner one evening was absolutely delicious. It was great to learn about the historical significance of Kasbah Amridil and its structure is easily identifiable on old 50 Dirham bills!",5.0
"We accidentally found this beautiful Kasbah located at the edge of the Skoura Palmeraie, right next to 17th century Kasbah Amridil. It has nicely decorated rooms and a great rooftop terrace amidst palm trees and Kasbahs. Owner and staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We felt very welcome and would definitely come back!",5.0
"Our visit was short but very intensive. In our stay we were only visitors in kasbah so we could fully appreciate hospitality and friendliness of our owner: he is not only kind and complaisant, also he is an interesting guide enthusiastic in his work and interesting to talk and to listen. For a reasonable price he showed a historical part of his hotel which is so nice to see and learn. Rooms were clean and authentic in a very sweet way. The food was VERY nice (the best breakfast and soup I've ever had in Morocco). The place Skoura is silent and good for a bike trip. Totally recomend you to visit this pace.",5.0
"How often does one get to experience a real kasbah in the middle of an oasis! There were so many wonderful things about our stay here.    - Early morning walk through the oasis - A tour of the famous and beautifully preserved Kasbah Amridil - Spectacular views of the sunset from the ramparts of the kasbah -  Our charming, entertaining host Reda and long conversation with him about Moroccan culture, how he met his wife, his marriage, his dreams and aspirations  - YUM dinner (especially the turkey kebabs were mouth watering) cooked by his lovely wife  - fun playing with his cute daughter  Note: The rooms are simple and small but the ambience is so genuine and unique and warm that one is willing to forgo some of the comforts that one can expect in a standard hotel.",4.0
"It is a rare combination of simplicity and elegance and one of the 2 very nice kasbahs where you can stay that we encountered on our recent tour - the other is Kasbah des Caids at Tamnougalt.  Reda has a sense of charm and humour and looks after his quests well. The Kasbah tour is more than recommended and combines the attributes of the Kasbah and Reda's infectious enthusiasm rather well.  Food is very good. You can have it in the hall or courtyard downstairs or in the terrace upstairs.  I took two walks in the oasis. One early, crispy winter morning walk into the village and oasis behind the kasbah to listen to the village waking up. And a late morning walk across the dry river bed onto the oasis on the opposite bank. Both are recommended - you probably don't need a guide if…",5.0
"This place was recommended by a friend of mind who visited Morocco three years ago. I truly enjoyed this peaceful place in a beautiful Oasis. The owner is a young Moroccan, Reda, who is the very proud owner of this historical hotel. The 16th century Kasbah is still owned by the same family, Reda's family. Reda is a courteous host, who surprisingly speaks Spanish as well. I was surprised when he addressed me in well spoken Spanish. He is speaks fluent English as well. When I arrived at the Kasbah, mid afternoon, I was asked if I was going to eat dinner and to chose from the menu. I found this a bit strange, but later on I realized that dinner is cooked from scratch by Reda's wife. I would advise to eat an early lunch, because the servings are plentiful. My dinner included…",5.0
"This was hotel was a random find for us- and how lucky we were. The host, Reda, was so nice and pleasant. The food cooked for us in the evening was one of our best meals in Morocco. The room was clean and had good AC. It was so quiet and peaceful.",5.0
"We stayed here for one night coming from the desert and on our way to the Dadés area.  The place is very easy to find, a sign will direct you left off the main road before Skoura. The atmosphere is relaxed, safe parking in front of the hotel, and basically you sleep almost inside of the kashab itself, so it is a special experience. The room was simple and clean. The bathroom is extremely small, as others before me have already mentioned and warm water is only available in the evening. Other than this, we had a friendly welcome and a quiet night here. Breakfast was one of the bests we had in Morocco: everything fresh, plenty for two, served with a smile on the face, accompanied by funny (and positive) remarks.  Wi-fi is available, it works both in the room and on the terrace, but…",5.0
"By now you’ve probably read all the awesome reviews of Kasbah Ameridil, and its charismatic host Reda – all of which are true. And if you’re reading this then you’re thinking of staying here – which is something I can wholeheartedly recommend. I won’t go into details of the Kasbah tour – it is great, and you can’t really do anything like it elsewhere, so you should definitely come here and do that with Reda (just email or call him the day before to arrange it).  And, unless you're enroute to somewhere else, you should really consider staying here to just decompress, soak up the atmosphere, and enjoy the environment.

The proximity to the Kasbah is great, but be aware that there are two separate charges to tour the whole facility.  We went for a nice walk around the oasis.  The food was just adequate (and may--or may not--have been the source of a bacterial illness).  We would explore other options before recommending.",3.0

"We stayed in this Kasbah on our way to Sahara Desert. It was an amazing stay. The fact we staying in a 300 year old kasbah was an amazing experience, the couple who owns the place were friendly and helpful. The wife cooks amazing Moroccan meal and even showed us around the kitchen area and explain to us what the concept of tagine is like. We were the only couple that night at the kasbah, it felt amazing. We loved our stay there and will definitely recommend people to stay here!",5.0

"Unreal!  Fantastic hosts, great food, a real Kasbah.  Walking around the roads in nearby you get such a sense of what this place has been for hundreds of years.  Really, it is quite untouched.  The new guest house part of the kasbah is literally attached to the ancient kasbah, and you can walk the grounds - a guided tour is recommended, very entertaining!

"My husband, two children, mother and father in law toured the historic Kasbah and stayed overnight in the attached modernized section of the Kasbah.  It is truly magical.  We stayed in a room up in one of the turrets of the Kasbah and ate dinner in the main courtyard.  The dinner was delicious and was delightfully and humorously serviced by Reda.  Reda who manages the property, hosted during our stay.  It was such a pleasure to talk with Reda and meet his beautiful family.  We had a tour of the historical section of the Kasbah that was informative and engaging.  Our family would highly recommend this place to all travellers.",5.0

As we were dryving through the region, we were frustrated by the lack of information on how to find an appropriate place to spend the night and where to have supper.

We were tired and frustrated but the warm reception we received by the inn keaper changed our moods instantly. after receiving a wonderful Moroccan homemade meal we chnaged oue travel plans for the next day to explore the historic Kasbah, a building tha figures in many well known movies.

"What a remarkable place! I echo the other reviewers who wished they had stayed longer than one night. It truly has the feel of being in an ancient place, with the enclosed garden, the semi-ruin of the great kasbah with which the riad shares a wall and the garden of the old kasbah, with cats lounging in the sun under a trellis of grape vines, and outside the high walls the palmeraie with its olive groves and date palms and dozens of old kasbahs and village lanes to the west, and to the east the desert... food is excellent, you can sit at separate tables but we joined with another couple from Italy at our table and had a blast telling stories.

"Kasbah Amridil is an incredible place, built in the traditional mud and straw style (in keeping with the old Kasbah next door) it is also comfortable and modern where it matters. Reda was extremely welcoming, and gave us local dates with Moroccan tea when we arrived, and a delicious evening tagine.  Located down a side road just outside Skoura, Kasbah Amridil is well signposted and easy to find even though we arrived as it was going dark (just head for the massive old Kasbah). Reda gave us a fascinating tour of the old Kasbah the next day, full of enthusiasm and knowledge of the old ways of life. The surrounding oasis is worth exploring too.",5.0
"This Kasbah is the real thing!  We stooped here for one night when traveling across the mountains from the desert to Marrakesh and wished we had stayed for several more nights.  It is a traditional mud and straw building with all mod cons in the hotel part, There is an archway to the older Kasbah that has been partly restored and guided tours are provided by the local family its well worth the stay just for this!  The hotel is nestled within a large palm oasis (25Km) of which you can spend days exploring, the hotel can provide guides, maps, bikes, whatever you need. The staff are very friendly and are keen to tell you as much as you like about the history, architecture, or culture of the area.   The food is excellent, very fresh and prepared exactly as you would like.",5.0
"Kasbah Amridil was just the best place we stayed in Morocco. The food was out of this world, cooked with Love by Redas beautiful wife, Amina. The bed was very comfortable and the room quiet and cool. The Shower was great also. Rada was the perfect host and always took time to show us round the Old Kasbah,( An amazing place to visit) tell us stories about his ancestors and make maps for us to go biking. The biking was one of our greatest adventures The panoramic view of the Oasis and mountains was stunning. Just riding through the date palms and olives sprinkled with green alfalfa was a joy on a sunny day.Skoura is the best place to relax!!Thankyou Rada and Amina for making our trip to Morocco so memorable.

"I spent two nights at Kasbah Amridil with my parent. We were welcomed by Reda and from then until the end of our stay we thoroughly enjoyed his friendliness and hospitality. The meals that were included in the half board were delicious and served at our leisure. Our rooms had both heat and air conditioning with a remote and hot showers and there were really great common areas to hang out in. Reda gave us a map for a 2-3 hour hike through the palmeries and past crumbling kasbahs that we split up with a lunch break in the middle. The hotel was a good base for us to do a day trip to the Dades Gorge (we had a rental vehicle). Our stay at Amridil was one of the highlights of our trip,",5.0
"Spent 2 wonderful nights at this traditional hotel that is actually attached to the Kasbah Amridil, the area's top architectural attraction. The number one attraction are the beautiful palm groves that surround it for miles around. Reda was as friendly and helpful as any hotel manager we've met - giving us information on the area, describing a hike and arranging transportation. The rooms are small but nice and have individual heaters, there is wifi on the bottom level and the food was great. It is about 2 kilometres outside of Skoura - easy by car, or a 30dr ride in a tri-moto. Highly recommended.",5.0

"I stayed here a couple of weeks ago. I arrived late in Skoura without having booked a hotel, but a local shopkeeper knew the owner of Espace Kasbah Amridil, who sent a guy on a moped to pick me up. The manager, Reda, gave a very friendly welcome and supplied good home-cooked food. You can hire bikes to visit the palmeraie or simply take a walk; the manager can supply a simple map with a good 2 hour route, recommended. The palmeraie is beautiful, particularly if you walk or bike to a place with a good view. Overall, I highly recommend this place: very friendly welcome, calm and quiet, right next door to the historic monument, good food and good value.",5.0
"Espace Kasbah Amridil, in the Skoura oasis, is housed in what is actually a new extension to one of the oldest and largest kasbahs in Morocco  (and one of the most well know, since it featured on the old 50 dirham note and on the carton of a large brand of orange juice). This means you are more or less spending the night in a monument of national importance. The rooms are not very exceptional (and a bit dusty - but this is unavoidable with mud brick architecture, I suppose), but this is overshadowed by the fact that your sleeping in an impressive fortified house, with a view over the oasis. The Maison d'Hotes is run by a very friendly and helpful young manager, who also acts as a guide to the historic parts of the kasbah, and serves lovely home cooked food.",4.0
"Over 100 mosquitos in the room. When adressed, they sprayed the entire room (we couldn’t enter for 1.5h because of the smell) Afterwards all dead mosquitos were laying on the ground and on the bed and they were never removed.

Good points: - friendly staff at reception - nice “movie set” atmosphere",2.0
Very unique hotel. Rooms nice and clean with lots of movie star pictures…. But very small…  Reception and staff were very friendly   Dinner was terrible 😞 We were 8 people…. It was a pre paid dinner… first course was salad. It was rich and fresh.  Main course was beef with vegetables. It was really bad…. Most of us returned it almost untouched ….

Despite receiving the confirmation from both booking and the property yesterday evening , we were on the way to Ourzazate, in the middle of the high atlas mountains when i received a call from the hotel, informing me that we  would have to pay 74% extra per room and per night. They claimed that the rate that was on booking was too low and that it was  booking’s fault and that if we don’t pay the extra we wouldn’t be able to check-in. They were rude, disrespectful and didn’t care when we told them that it’s almost double the price and that we had a tight budget. They replied by saying that It was not their problem.   When booking called them they lied and stated that they were overbooked.   Watch out!!!",1.0

They will wait on you, literally wait on you long after the restaurant is closed. They will remember what you have for breakfast every morning.  Remember, this is a small town with a large film studio. So there may be certain things you won't get out there in the desert. However, the people at the hotel have a big heart.  Ask for Hind or Mohammed and they will give you the best service. The hotel is great and willing to do better. They have upgraded over the last year and definitely have a home feel ambience.   Safe, cozy and sound place to stay...",5.0
"I can honestly say we had a truely awful experience at this hotel from start to finish. (This is the first time I have given such a poor review for any hotel). We arrived slightly later than expected due to our tour mini bus breaking down so we were tired and looking forward to what we expected to be a good hotel. As we arrived we were told to hurry up or we would miss our dinner (the restaurant was open for at least another hour) so our immediate reaction to staff welcoming guests was not great. We then went to our room, where the evening got even worse. The room was small, dingy and not particularly clean. There were no bedside tables due to the beds being crammed into the small space, the wardrobe was blocked by a table and the sink and mirror was in the small hallway, presumably becuase the bathroom wasnt big enough for it. The bathroom had mould around the tiles and dirt around the floor tiles, the shower holder was broken and there wasnt anywhere to hang towels. It was not what we were expecting so I went back to reception to complain to simply be told it was a deluxe room and they thought it was fine, refusing to even discuss the matter with me - this conversation started in English and finished with the receptionist suddenly stating he didnt understand English. The restaurant is small, the food was average and the staff were rude. It transpired that we only had a short period for our meal as there was a large party having a private meal in the restaurant, with no provisions set for guests. Breakfast was awful so we ended up with a bowel of cereal. We were on a tour and the other couple with us suffered a similar experience.  This was a really disappointing and upsetting experience and as such (based on our experience) I would not recommend this hotel to others.…",1.0

"Having travelled around Morocco and stayed in a number of hotels, i can comfortably say that this was the least appealing of all. Both the hotel rooms our tour group stayed in were far below expectations, despite being described as ""Deluxe"" by Oscar Hotel. The bath in our room was truly horrible. The food served for both dinner and breakfast was unappetising. The hotel's proximity to Atlas Studios is the only thing giving it 2/5.",2.0
"We arrived late (around 8.30pm) after being stranded for 2hrs with a broken vehicle, looking forward to a nice room and good dinner, we did not get it. First the room, it was tiny, the decor was poor, tiles didn't meet the walls, the bath was rusting and had been painted, there were hairs in the bath tub when we arrived and the floor was dusty. Had we not been coming from the desert we may not gave been brave enough to use the shower which shot water out sideways. When we got into bed the bottom sheet was so old and worn it was bobbly and rough on your skin, very uncomfortable.  The food was barely edible it was unappealing to look at and worse to eat. Dinner and breakfast as bad as each other. At dinner dessert was almost non-existent as it had been cleared to make way for a large group. That being said the large Jewish group were staying and the special food prepared separately for them looked very tasty - clearly the hotel is happy to cater for groups special dietary considerations which is good to see. One of our group asked to pay for his drinks, and was told no charge so left to go to his room. A little later another staff member came over to ask where he was, it turned out the 1st waiter spoke no English but had not gone for help. The staff were pretty aggressive about the situation and annoyed we didn't know our companion's room number. We were happy to cover their drinks but the staff attitude was bad.  In the morning we did take a look around and it looked like some of the poolside rooms had been redone and looked quite nice. Considering we had booked deluxe rooms we would not say this hotel lived up to expectations and suggest you look for alternative accommodation in this location.…",2.0

Waiters of dinning room were over dressed like putting on a ritz. It’s a Just a casual resort hotel neighbouring the dessert. Travellers are not going to attend with tie & jacket, etc.... Room is spacious and well decorated. Inclusive dinner was tasty but boring. I can recommend it as an acceptable stop over hotel.",4.0
"To start with room is very small but at least it was clean. There is a small yard, which is the only area you can drink alcohol in. In the hotel there is a bar which does not sell anything and during dinner you cant even take your wine to the table nor near the pool. Dinner was horrible everything cold and once something finishes is not replaced so people who went for dinner at 8.45om found nothing. Breakfast was the left over from dinner including vegetables, potatoes it was beyond horrible. Pity cause the setup and idea behind the hotel is nice but everything else was not good.",2.0
I booked this hotel for my first visit to the atlas mountains. The receptionist Maria was very helpful on our arrival.  After a night sleep I was sitting in the lounge in reception and one of the manageress Hind asked if we were happy with our two rooms. I said we were. Over the next few days I asked about various things from attractions to shops. At all times the ladies were helpful. The restaurant served a buffet which was value for money. At all times the restaurant staff we very efficient. The Director of the hotel always greeted me whenever he saw me. On our last night we were given an upgrade to a suite We found this excellent customer service and would like to thank the Director and his team. Would definitely recommend this hotel,5.0

Also we have beautiful views over the studios and amazing saharan dunes/mountains. We ran into some problems and had to change rooms to another suite.

Nice entrance (door to door with atlas studio) , good lobby and pool area - at this point, I thought the other reviews could have been written by very picky travelers which expect top level brands treatment in a small/mid size  town in the middle of the desert.

I will report the problem to Google!  The hotel is within the studio walls and coulda been a film set itself! with filmic ornaments scattered tastefully around the pool. Every so often a small band of travellers would rock up to the hotel, drink at the bar, dip their weary legs in the pool and then take a guided tour around the Atlas Film Studios.

"AVOID THIS HOTEL  Booked and paid for through a travel agent. We stayed for two nights - I wish we had packed up and paid to go elsewhere for the second night.  The only member of staff who spoke to us in a pleasant way was the room maid. Reception staff, brusque and unhelpfull. Coffee undrinkably bad, breakfast stale. Rooms very tired.  We were the only guests - I wonder why ?  I've visited Morocco many times over the last 30 years and stayed in dozens of hotels - this place was the worst of the lot - avoid",2.0

The Hotel is better than its photos on Trip Advisor. The staff is very friendly and the service is good. Food is amazing - Best Tajine in Ouarzazate. The rooms are pretty big & clean.

"Next door to the interesting Atlasstudio`s (first visit at 08.30 hrs; half hour visit). It is really not a B&B but a normal but good hotel, good breakfast, perfect rooms but without personal touch of course. Good value for its money, and practically to arrive late and leave early. From here we visited first the studio`s, take a dive in the pool, than the city castle of ourzazate, ait ben haddou, the nice road to telouet, the T&Tpass, trough Marrakech to arrive at about 22 hrs at Essaouira.

"We stayed here for one night on the way back from an Erg Chebbi desert trek.  The hotel is a bit surreal in that it's the grounds of a deserted desert film studio and has mummies and Egyptian paraphernalia everywhere.  I think we stayed at a particularly quiet time - there were 6 other guests at most - so perhaps some of the faded Hollywood glamour and mystique was missing!  Our room was quite large with an ensuite as well as a separate washbasin behind the door.  It  was clean and comfortable, but our clothes did reek a bit of mothballs for a few days afterwards.   There is a swimming pool for cooling off, with some loungers and chairs dotted around it.

Wonderful pool with faux Hollywood feel style.  We really enjoyed ourselves.  Breakfast was a bit bland but generally good.  I would still recommend staying here.",4.0
Attached to the Atlas Films studios the hotel has a unique atmosphere unlike any other and does it best to show off its cinema history and provide a relaxing contempory mood. Rooms are clean but basic and the quality of your bathroom and number of TV channels can be luck of the draw. At around 3km outside Ouarzazate you will need a car for most journey but it should also be noted that taxi are cheap as chips.  Communal areas are very nice with a lot made of its cinema pedigree with signed photos and movie props in abundance. The restaurant offers a good mix of international favourites from bolognese to burgers alongside traditional Moroccan dishes. Drinks can be a little pricey but the movie themed 'Gladiator' bar makes up for it.  The main appeal comes from being in a hotel in…,4.0
"I stayed at this hotel for one night en route to the desert.  The hotel's facilities were exactly what we were looking for - the hotel was basic but comfortable.  The hotel is located on the outskirts of Ouarzazate, right next door to Atlas Studios.  Apart from the studio, the hotel is not convenient to the sights or amenities of Ouarzazate and it would be difficult to get around without a car.    We also had a problem with noise on the property - a very large school group was staying on the property on the same night we were there.

"The worst 15 hours of our entire trip! And it cost 1750 Dirhams, the most expensive place of the trip! A total rip off!!! We arrived to the hotel around 7pm. It was much further off the main road that expected. Took almost 30 mins. We didn’t have reservations, but on booking.com it was listed at $46 a night for 4 people. They told us when we arrived they didn’t have any rooms, but there were 5 keys on the desk of available rooms. A few mins after they said no, they made some calls and said yes for 800 Dhs! All part of the scam, I’m sure. We were tired and hungry so we stayed even after conversations and proof of booking.com rate, which they disconnected after I mentioned it. We went for dinner at 8:15pm as one family finished their their meal and no others in the restaurant. We ordered immediately and didn’t finish for 2.5 hrs! It was ridiculous!  And the food was just ok. We went to bed. In the morning we had an ok breakfast buffet. The wifi didn’t work, yet they gave out the password like it did! We were ready to leave! I went to check out and they over charged me and blamed it on their math skills, yet it was just another way for him to get more cash from us. The guy I was dealing with is part of the owners family! A real jerk! Stay away! It’s a pretty spot, but not worth the drive, hassle, money, or time!…",1.0

"Most of the people come for a night. And then they regret for such a short staying.   We choose to stay a month. And it couldn't be better in any way.

They built a swimming pool, new air conditionar and heating system, lots of table games to play, wifi only in the restaurant but if you ask you can get a moden just for your room and the list goes on and on.   For sure the best improvement was at the restaurant. The service is outstanding. I will miss Omar the waiter and the very good talks we had almost everyday. And the food is super tasty.

The second stay none of us had water at all and think about that, no flushing toilets, no showers, not even water for cleaning your teeth. Perhaps the most annoying feature was the hotel had to be cajoled into providing bottled water. Also the hotel accepted the bookings for 12 persons and the permutations divided into double and single occupancy, also the price was not anything other than expensive, and guess what? Yep they overbooked involving an individual having to stay in a different hotel. So the long and the short of the story, would I stay there again or take a group there? Would I…",1.0

It also would be nice to have a chair in the room. This is the reason, why I, travelling a lot around the world, did not give this place 5 stars. But an Ecolodge is a little different.

The issue is probably coming from the fact that this resort is totally green. They grow vegetables, use solar water heaters and solar panels.

The price asked was 20 euros (10 times what we've paid elsewhere), then adjusted down only a little when I questioned the cost, but was told it was because of 'taxes.'

Also they have a very nice restaurant and very big rooms. The wi-fi was also very good, since it was inside our room... We could never expect that.  Thanks for everything",5.0
"We had opportunity to stay at this place several times. 10 or 12 nights during different occasions.   Youssef and all the staff of Ecolodge Lile, are out of this world. They will make everything possible to guarantee to you the best days ever.   The room is big, spacious and very well decorated. We had a King Size bed who provided us the best night sleep in Morocco. The ecolodge is located next to the Barrage, what made possible to us make activities like kayak, drive quads in one incredible landscape and even camel rides he provided to us.   Everything with a very cheap price. During our staying we could see guests from all over the world leaving extremely satisfied thanks to the excellent service that this Ecolodge have. They are setting a new standart of excellence in service…",5.0
We stayed here one night of our private tour with Morocco Unplugged (also highly recommend) to Merzouga / Erg Chebbi.   Great hotel concept for the area and eco friendly / sustainable.   The hotel manager / owner was great and very attentive to hotel guests.   Beautiful setting next to the lake and the stars at night are epic.   Wifi is also good but only available in the lobby / restaurant.   They have a few pet dogs (puppies when we were there) and cats which we loved playing with as we missed our pets from home.   Definitely recommend a stay if you're in the area.   Tip: try and get a room furthest away from the lobby / closest to the lake - it's nice and quiet and there's an outdoor seating area right outside your room.,5.0
"Pros:  - The entire facility is off the grid by using solar panels for power.   - The lodge also grows it's own food and livestock to feed the guests, and draws its own well water. - Youssef and the entire staff are *incredibly* friendly and a tour of the net-zero energy facility is a must.   - The rooms are clean and have western amenities. - The rooftop patio provides an aerial view of the reservoir and some of Ouarzazate.  Cons: - We stayed during the summer months and the rooms were very hot at night (surprised?).  More airflow through the rooms at night would help bring the cool outside air in and provide more comfortable sleeping conditions.",5.0
"The location of this hotel is beautiful, next to the big lake of Ouarzazate. No city noise or hassle here, only the wind and beautiful panoramas. It can be a little hard to find. There is a sign 'Youssef et frères', then follow the white marks off road.   The room was by far the best we had in Morocco. It was spacious, nicely decorated and clean. The bed was oversized. The place is only a few months old. Dinner was okay, a little expensive compared to other places.   We paid about 22 euro, breakfast included.",5.0
"It's well off big roads, poorly marked.  We drove around several times to find the turn.  Even then we couldn't find it, so we gave up, called and asked for someone to come out.  We had data plan, GPS on my iPhone.  I thought the rooms were average, nothing special.",3.0

ca. 10 km outside of Quarzarate  You can enjoy here peace and a lot of space. Very loving Atmophäre - very friendly Delicious breakfast on a sunny terrace.  Next overlooking a lake.

In about 20 minutes drive through small villages you come  to Quarzazate,5.0
"I'm almost afraid to say something because the joy of this place is in its solitude. Overlooking a lake and mountains it is away from the ever-increasing bustle of Ouarzazate. Nothing around it. Quiet, peaceful, the perfect place to  be still. If you want activity don't come here. If you are with a group and want to socialize don't. If you want to be still, come. BTW, they serve huge portions of utterly delicious food, much of it organically grown on the property. If Hussain still works there, hang out with him.

I have never been happy and so comfortable as much as I was in this magnificent place. I wish if I can stay there forever. I liked everything in (Maison d'hote Ecolodge A Ouarzazate): poeple are very welcoming there because everybody is nice and lovely...the food is delicious...the nature very beautiful...and I loved the room the way they made it with fabilous and original decoration...Thank you guys for the excilent services you offered me with all love and I will come back and stay longer !😊,5.0
"This Ecolodge is new and unique. Their principle is to grow their own vegetables, herbs and corn. That´s why it is located a little bit out of Oarzazate but definitely worth of staying. The quietness is guaranteed – no 4 a.m. wake up because you can´t hear from Ouarzazate the morning´s first pray calling  ;-) .    The room was spacious and modern including king-sized bed. Bathroom was clean and there were some free toiletries. Dinner and breakfast were served in a separate building where was also free WiFi available.

"This is a new place.  Very large rooms with king sized beds.  Traditional architecture in a private location overlooking the water, a bit distant from the city of Ouarzazate.  The staff were very accommodating.  You can enjoy meals outside or in a dining room.  Each building has two rooms, each with a bathroom.  Overall the experience was very good, but as this is a place designed to let you experience nature, be aware that there is no heat in the rooms.  While I am sure that it is lovely in the springtime, it was a bit chilly in late December, so be prepared for that.  The beds have loads of thick blankets, so we slept quite well.",4.0
"We stayed at Rose Noir for 1 night. First of all, almost impossible to find! Upon arrival no one was there to welcome us in french/english/Spanish, only the chambermaid in Arabic. Owner would come in few minutes she told us after we used Google translate, nut nope, owner never showed up. The room was dusty, ice-cold and the bed was like laying on a rock! Bathroom was also poorly decorated, messy and smelled funny. Breakfast was average. Overal, would not recommend anyone to stay there. ",2.0
"We have a very bad experience. It's the worst Riad we had ever been. The breakfast is the worst... Nothing is fresh neither homemade... The air conditioners did not work, therefore our fiends did not sleep in the first night as it was so damm hot inside. The fotos you see on TripAdvisor or other sites like booking.com are not real. Lots of photoshop and therefore what you get is a bad experience. The way to get the hotel is a nightmare, as you can see in the fotos, the bathroom is very tinny and the water in the shower flooded.The internet does not existe. If you think it can't be that bad... look at the fotos I post with my review ",1.0
"Beware that this hotel is definitely not what You read on the critics. Fist of all, the streets that lead to it are filled with mud, dirt and no lighting (very important for people who arrive late in the evening)! There are also no signs so you’ll have to wait for your driver to lead you there, as the streets are narrow and cars cannot make it to the entrance.  The hotel itself is a dump. Very hot, the AC in the rooms doesn’t work properly. Ours was leaking inside the room, and in our friends room it didn’t go bellow 29 degrees.   Our room resembled a medieval torture Chamber and was very dark. The bathroom was tiny, the shower was a joke. You had to hold the shower head to be able to shower, and the drain didn’t work so that meant the bathroom was flooded every day. The hair dryer only works for about 30 seconds before shutting down.  Let’s not even talk about breakfast!! There iogurt and the juices are store bought, and you have to fight with a family of flies to be able to try and eat!! Also note that the breakfast is usually serve on the terrace at the top of the building, still if they do find its resonable to serve it elsewhere, they DON’T WARN YOU WHATSOEVER!!  As you can see by now, the staff is everything but nice. Only the lady speaks (some) English and note they DONT accept VISA!! They only accept cash. The lady had the nerve to say to us that we “didn’t ask” when we panicked when we heard that we wouldn’t be able to pay with card!   Worst experience possible! Stay AWAY!…",1.0
"First of all, very difficult to find or get there.Construction all around. We decided to go and see if possible to find other hotels more customer friendly. asked for a restroom and were not allowed but  were charged for the room anyway. At present its not in good condition, maybe in the past",1.0
"Located behind the Kasbah next to the souk and mosque. Beautifully decorated, the building, public areas and rooms make you feel like you are in one thousand nights. Rooms are clean and spacious, there is a roof terrace and a dining room downstairs. The staff is very friendly and the food is amazing. You will hear the muazzin’s call for prayer loud and clear in the wee hours but it makes the place even more charming. ",5.0
"Hotels an B&B are numerous in this little town but La Rose Noire deserves a very special note! This charming B&B offers ample bedrooms nicely decorated, breakfast on the terrace with a perfect view over the Kasbah and the valley, as well as a stork's nest atop the mosque tower, but best of all Jemmiaa's local food cooking is the best in town! In addition not only is she, and Jean-Pierre, taking great care of her clients but she also finds time to answer all questions and to support a group of needy women. In short, the B&B is great, quiet and well managed and its beauty will please anyone entering it! ",5.0
"Hosts were extremely friendly and helpful. The kasbah hotel built with tradional materials is a real hide-away, hard to find (save with the help of locals, always greedy directing you through the narrow passages against a moderate tip). Once there, each room is individual, cosy and cool (we left A/C off all the time). Meals on rooftop with stunning views 360 degrees, receptionist did give us perfect advice as to fill our (two) days with sightseeing. Quiet, relaxed stay for everyone interested in the old part of Ouarzazarte.",5.0
"This is a nice riad. Rooms are fine  BUT the showers were not!  No shower pressure at all.  I have no idea why, but we would not have stayed, knowing this.   Based on this alone, I wouldn't recommend booking this.  It is nice to have basic amenities like showers, especially after long days in beautiful Morocco.",3.0
"In the old Jewish quarter, full of history. Beautifully restored authentic old riad.  We had a twin room with dinner and breakfast. Very good price, but you have to negotiate.  Fabulous roof terrace for breakfast and stunning evening views. Food was very tasty, traditional but beautifully presented. Wifi only down stairs but it worked. We found this place after a local ""guide"" led us there while showing us the old town. But we we were glad. ",5.0

We ate dinner here one night and it was one of our best meals in an eight day tour.   The rooftop terrace was superb for a sundowner or breakfast with great views. Big bedroom with huge comfy bed.   Only black mark is for a shower that delivered scalding hot or icy cold water, but not much in between, but a poor shower is a pet hate of mine.",4.0

I was one of the group brought to this riad by Alan Palmer and agree entirely with his review.

"Last week I took a group of travellers to La Rose Noire for an overnight stay on our tour of southern Morocco. We were provided with beautifully presented, large double rooms and suites, excellent food and a manageress whose quality of service, married both to her determination to succeed and to the warmth of her personality, ensured that our every wish was met. Tucked away in the heart of Ourrzazate's small medina, I would unquestionably choose to bring groups here again in the future. Trek in Morocco Limited.",5.0

You need to go through some dark allow way (ask the kids to guide your for a-2 DH), open a door- and the the ever reoccurring wonder of a RIad is there. Great terrace with a huge breakfast, nice spacious rooms. Quarzazate was a stop over on our way to the desert for us. On our way back we also stope at Rose Noire. we had decided to rent a car and explore some of the area around, but all car rentals were soled out. The owners managed to fix a car for us anyway, and also accommodation in Marakech at another recommendable place. They made sure we got to the restaurants we wanted and back safely and we are a lover very please with this place! It is run by a woman and this is good!:-) enjoy!",5.0
"After a few days in the dessert La Rose Noir offers a warm, clean and well equipped room. It was the first  Moroccan guesthouse we visit that was runned by a woman. Jmiaa, the owner, welcomes you with charm and warmth. The feeling for detail is noticeable. The terrace on the roof has a marvellous view, overlooking the kasbah. The dinner which is served on the terrace is prepared with care.  The location of La Rose Noir doesn't invite to go out in the evening. The modern part of Quarzazate is too far away and it doesn't feel pleasant to walk out there in the evening.  But La Rose Noir is is definitely worth staying.",4.0
"When my spouse and I looked back on our vacation in Morocco, our stay at the Rose Noise fell into the top 3 for both of us. We were not expecting much out of Ouarzazte, and we were expecting the highly-ranked Rose Noire to be out of our price range. We were actually astounded by the romantic charm of the Rose Noire in the depths of the kasbah and by the affordable pricing.   It was the most atmospheric evening of the trip. We had so much fun winding our way through the half-abandoned kasbah - tourist-free other than us! The views from the flowering roof deck were memorable.

We wanted a good place to eat and the owner walked us to a restaurant and picked us up to insure we wouldn't get lost. The next day in the light, we were able to navigate our way in and out of the kasbah with ease. On tripadvisor's map, the hotel isn't shown in the right place.

"When they say it's in the Kasbah, they mean it. Rose Noire is in the heart of a derelict mud kasbah, in front of that of Tarouirt, part of that of Tarouirt, more correctly. A bit daunting to find, but the more surprisingly authentic because of it. Our junior suite had ruby red  walls, a big and colorful iron bed, two similarly covered and cushioned sofas, some very decorative lamps and a  large orientalist painting.

Our room was delightful, with air conditioning, a large space for sitting, and a comfy bed. Our only complaint, and it's a constant in Morocco, was the tiny packets of dandruff shampoo and small bars of soap as the only toiletries that were offered. It was easy to look past this, though, with all of the other amenities the riad offered. We had standard breakfast on the rooftop.",5.0

Its amazing that places like this still exist in the modern world.  The rooms are of the same standard as you would expect from a modern hotel, no TV, but electricity, wifi in the lobby and nice showers etc.  I suppose the negatives are we had a dirty ash tray in our room, which we asked for none smoking, and a little bit pricey as a whole, especially if…",4.0

This is my first experience in a berber style riad. And its been a good one. Rose Noire is situated in the heart of Ouarzazate. Kasbah Taourirt  is walking distance from the hotel. Terrace has a good view and its good to go on top early morning. Things that stand out about the Rose Noire is the hospitality. Thats 5 out of 5. Both the hosts Jmiaa and Bernard are very helpful and nice. The design of the riad is mind blowing. Probably this could be my first Riad Visit. The hosts were very helpful when i fell ill during the stay. They send out a person to get medicine for me (Considering the pharmacy is quite far).  If you are looking for a personal or human touch rather than a normal hotel service look no further. Rose has certainly impressed me.,4.0

"The Riad is wonderful, as well the owners: Mr. Bernard and Mrs Jmiaa. The Riad is well located and the acces is very easy (in the Taourirt Kasbah). The decoration is splendid - our room was magical. The terrace view is also great, it is like we were in an epic movie. It is true that there is a mosque very near, but the prayers heard during the prayer times were not a problem at all - the sounds were very low and contributed to create an exotic atmosphere. An other high point was the ""Berber"" dinner, Mrs Jmiaa is in fact a great Chef. Besides, Mr. Bernard helped us by providing trip tips as well he personnaly took us to visit the movie studious. In a few words: ""Wonderful Riad. Wonderful hosts"".",5.0

"We booked this place last minute and wow, what a nice surprise. Near the Kasbah and in a quiet little back street it is amazing! Wonderful Touareg decoration and great view. Rooftop breakfast is amazing. The dinner is unbelievable! Like eating at home with the family, very nice family running the Riad. Shower is not good at all but would still highly recommend this place!",5.0
"We had a lovely stay, and they are serving the best food in Marocco! Great hospitality, we will certainly come back. Located in the heart of an old kasbah, a little difficult to find, but just ask someone inside the Kasbah, they are all very friendly. Nice view from the roof terrace, take your breakfast there!",5.0
"When we arrived with the taxi they told us to go through some dark alley ways and they just pointed us in a direction and left us there. There was no one to be seen, and you could only hear the loud noises of the kasbah which was next door calling for prayer. It was impossible to find, I lost my partner and it was extremely scary!   The hotel itself, the owner is not a very plesant man, he appears to be drunk all the time and mumbles some English from time to time. The woman working at the hotel were OK, but don't expect a smile back from the cleaning ladies. The hotel smells very dirty, like filthy animals, they have several dogs and birds who make noise non-stop. The room is OK, although it looked like it wasn't cleaned properly before we arrived, there was still stuff from…",1.0
"Brilliant entry to the Maison des hotes which is  located near the Kasbah. We had a wonderful large room with all requirements including airco. After five minutes we felt at home and the French owner has a well stocked fridge! Excellent chilling on the roof terrace and you feel as if you are traveling through time. Great view, quiet and with a plentiful and delicious breakfast. Certainly an unforgettable place to stay and a good basis for exploring the surroundings including a trip to the Sahara desert.",5.0
"First the negatives: bathroom could be improved and it's a pity not to have a parasol on the terrace for the heat.   That aside, we had a great stay and were made to feel very welcome. Nothing is too much trouble, from pick-up and drop-off, if notice is given in time, to requests for advice about our visit.  Located near to the kasbah, the rooms (we peeked into them all) are fabulous and the meals (breakfast and dinner) are huge. Our room had a great view looking away from the city towards the mountains. We took breakfast on the terrace and, later, spent a wonderfully romantic evening there gazing at the stars.   Very good value for money.",4.0
Bernard the owner and his staff went out of their way to welcome us. We were apparently the only visitors which was a shame. The dinner was very nice and he had several wines available for very reasonable prices. He is French after all!  Our stay was very nice and the view from the terrace is excellent.,4.0
"La Rose Noire is a fantastic place to stay when you are in Ouarzazate. The hotel is perfectly located in the middle of the medieval kasbah. From the terrase from where we were served our delicious Moroccan breakfast, we could overlook Ouarzazate and the beautiful snow-capped Atlas mountains. The rooms were nice and spacious and decorated in authentic style. La Rose Noire is like a Berber museum and the whole kasbah is wonderfully restored. Thanks to the owners Bernard and Jmiaa for the warm welcome and for serving us tasteful tagines together in a friendly atmosphere. We will highly recommend this place.",5.0
"When we arrived very tired late at night in Ouarzazate ,  we were picked  up by Bernard , the owner of ‘ l’auberge de larosenoire’.  Walking through the Kasbah in the dark for just a short distance, we wondered   where we were going…. Then a door opened and we found ourselves in a place almost like out of 1001 nights, being welcomed by Jmiaa, Bernard’s wife. It was the perfect spot to start our trip and to get in the ambiance of the south of Morocco! The rooms of this beautifully renovated house in the middle of the old Kasbah are arranged on different levels around an interior courtyard. Their charm is due to furniture, carpets and elements of Moroccan handicraft, assembled with taste and love .The terrace alone, with its breathtaking views, the peaceful atmosphere makes you…",5.0
"We stayed 4 nights at the Rose Noir where the setting and atmosphere were most pleasant and the staff were generally helpful and friendly. It is therefore with some regret that I have to report that we were robbed from my money belt inside my case while we were staying at the hotel. In total 800 Dirhams, 50 Euros and 40 Pounds were stolen along with a jersey and a couple of other items from my friend's case. As the thief was so selective we assumed it must have been housekeeping staff. On reporting the theft to the owner Bernard, he replied that it was impossible... we refrained from going to the police... There are no safes in the rooms. If you stay there, make sure you padlock your cases shut when you go out for the day!!!!  On another note, they only have solar heated water:…",2.0
"Rose Noire is a wonderful riad in the heart of the Ouarzazate medina.  The owners Bernard, Jmiaa, and Hassan took amazing care of us during our stay.  The riad is perfectly located, overlooking Ouarzazate from the medina.  The rooms were very comfortable, clean, and tastefully decorated.  Hassan gave us a great tour of the medina, complete with a visit to his aunt's restaurant.  We had a family emergency and Bernard and Hassan went far out of their way to make sure that everything was OK.   On top of that, Bernard voluntarily drove us to the airport at 5.30 in the morning.  We can't say enough about our experience at Rose Noire and will certainly stay there the next time we are in Ouarzazate.",5.0
"A warm and kindly family welcome into an ancient riad. Traditional decor, beautifully decorated rooms (plus some epic film props from Hollywood/Ouarzazate) and modern plumbing . The most amazing moroccan food and a breathtaking view form the breakfast terrace - storks and all. This is a family hotel and Bernard and his wife take good care of you, right from the first approach through the labyrinth of the old town wattle walls to the minivan ride back to the airport.",5.0
"I am at a loss to find positive criticism for the Rose Noire. We were disappointed by the hotel, it's surroundings the pretentions of the vendors, the quality of the goods and the character of the town. It compares poorly with some of our favourite Moroccon towns, even with some of our less favourite ones and, sad to say the tone was set by the black rose",1.0
"This beautiful hotel is right in the middle of the Kasbah and is reached through small and misterious alleys. Our room had a lovely decor all in deep red and our bathroom was all covered in warm coloured tiles. The house is wonderfully restored and the terrace alone was worth our trip to Morocco. It gives onto the Kasbah on one side and the mountains and palms on the other. The amazing moroccan breakfast on the terrace every morning was memorable. We had dinner at the hotel twice and the food prepared by the owner was a real family style berber meal with tagine and couscous full of delicious spices. The owners are not only lovely and friendly hosts, they are very interesting people very comitted to their surrounding community. Our daughter loved to play with their little dog and…",5.0
"A very gently, and nice Riad with a beautifull view from the Marrocain roof over the oasis. The breakfast on the roof is a feast in itself. Unfortunately, we did't taste the meal, because we did't reserve in time.  Don't miss La Rose Noire when you are in the Ouarzazate!",5.0
"Nice place in quarzazate, especially the roof terrace is magnificent. The looks of this Riad are splendid. Only downside is the mosque which is very close and starts calling the people for prayer very early in the morning. But maybe that's the charm of Morocco...",4.0
Rose-Noire surpassed out expectations.  The rooms are fantastically decorated and the roof top terrace is splendid.  The location is even more of a delight because getting to Rose-Noire requires walking thru several small alleyways and under several small archways which will take you past the local mosque as you pass children playing in the streets.  It's location offers a world of discovery away from the tourist attractions in town.  Probably the best value for the money throughout our 2 weeks in Morocco.  Simply define.,5.0
"This is a genuine guesthouse were the owners (Bernard & Jmiaa) will do all they can to make you feel like at home. The place is located inside the kashbah and it is great to get to know the real people and life from Ouarzazate, Jmiaa is orginary from the kasbah and she explained that everyone living there is like a family. The roof terrace they have is amazing, we had breakfast there and it was great. We had dinner once and the food was also really tasty, you can see all the efforts that Jmiaa is putting on the kitchen are worth since the food she prepares is fantastic! I would recommend everyone staying here and enjoying the home made dinner at least once! We spent 1 week in Morocco (Marrakech, Merzouga, etc) and this is by far the best place we stayed!",5.0

Right next to the Kasbah, down a few alleys, past a few friendly shop owners (who will shake your hand in welcome as you make your way to the L'auberge for the first time).  Owner? Open, friendly French/Berber couple (Bernard & Jmiaa), happy to share information about the people and the region.

"In our our opinion by far the best area to stay  in in Ouarzazate; the kasbah is spectacular with views across the hills and desert from the terraces. The rest of the town is dusty and a bit sleazy so this is a nice gettaway. The staff / family are extremely friendly, they will show you the kasbah, get you free entry to the film studios and generally go the extra mile for you. It is true that the rooms do not have their own bathrooms,  but this is a small price to pay for staying in such an amazing place. The small dog is extra entertainment and the auberge plans to expand over the next year so hopefully more people will be able to enjoy the experience of staying there. We would definitely go back.

"Rose Noir was one of the mid-range accommodations recommended in the Lonely Planet. Overall, the place was decent and you get what you pay for! We were lucky to have a choice of rooms, and so we opted for the luscious “Lover’s Room”, it was spacious and had a great view! However, the door was more of a partition with a thick heavy curtain to provide visual privacy but not auditory privacy. Essentially you could hear everyone passing by the door and the entire on goings within the complex. Another feature that I was unprepared for was the common facilities, which was not mentioned in the Lonely Planet. I’m not really a big fan of common facilities. The washrooms were clean, however, I think the Rose Noir may have had some problems with their water filtration system because after…",2.0

Beside the wonderful dinner on the roof of the riad and lovely breakfast it have been the people who made our stay remarkable. The riad had a higher standard then the one I saw before and after in other places. A busy street is close by, so we could capture some local vibes. Thanks for having us and your personal-warm, welcoming way 🙏",5.0
"This Riad (only the second Riad I've ever been to, so I'm no expert) was a great base for exploring the area. Our room was comfortable and all of the basics worked well.  There were two main people running the place. One was a really odd bloke who probably didn't mean to be rude but just had little to no people skills. The other was an absolute diamond who did his level best to help us out.  Our arrival at the Riad wasn't the best- our dinner wasn't ready and there was no idea when it might be ready and simple requests- vegetarian food for my wife which they already should have been prepared for, a blanket because we had been seated in a very cold area away from the other guests- seemed difficult for the staff to deal with. In the end we essentially demanded and got, better service and the nice staff member really tried his best to be helpful.  By the end I generally liked the place and you probably will too, but the staff member with no people skills could really do with a bit of training.…",4.0

The rooms are the most modern and comfortable of any Riad I've stayed at and the staff and extremely charming and accommodating, we loved it!",5.0
"Don't we worried about the outside of the Riad or the drive up to it.  It is very nice once you step into it.  Huge well equipped rooms which are updated and modern.  The service is outstanding.  They have a beautiful Terrace where breakfast was served. You can overlook the town from the upper level. We actually bought our own bottle of wine and enjoyed the evening on the terrace. Alcohol is not served at the Riad, although it says it has a bar and lounge.  Dinner was included which was typical Morrocon.  Bottom line.  Highly recommended without reservation",5.0
"Evaluation   The Riad Ksar Aylan was the best hotel during our stay in Marocco. The hotel is finely decorated with Marroquin pieces of art. It is charming and well located in the center of Ouarzazate.  Everything in the hotel is fine – the rooms are large, clean ad have all you need.  The restaurant is absolutely amazing, serving delicious Marroquin food finely prepared by their staff.  The restaurant is located the roof of the hotel with tables displaced in kind of a tent. In the early morning, we can observe the sunrise in an impressive red sky and listen to people praying at a near mosque. It is a magic moment.  In the evening, we could also observe a spectacular sunset.  Another thing that is important to mention is that we could select the time we want to dine. At the agreed time, delicious Marroquin dishes were waiting for us in the tent on the roof of the hotel. The service is outstanding. Everyone is wondering to help you at any time.  The Riad Ksar Aylan was one of the top places during our stay in Marocco. We highly recommend the hotel.…",5.0

The staff here are friendly, efficient and the rooms are unique and welcoming. I had the best meal of my travels here with a Beef and Prune Tagine…yum!

The neighbourhood is very unspectacular with not much on offer, but then this would be the case in most of Ouarzazate. When we arrived staff was very helpful when parking the car and getting our luggage to the room.

It was just after Christmas and upon arrival we were dazzled with tinsel, trees and lights in all areas of the hotel. Not what we were expecting at all but a welcome change to the norm, mostly down to Hassam’s time he spent I the UK and his warm-hearted nature. Of all the places we visited, no greeting and goodbye was a nice as Hassam’s, he is a real gentleman and to have the please of his company is worth the visit alone.   The rest of the hotel was clean, the rooms spacious, and the WiFi good, and you can’t say that about WiFi in many places in rural Morocco. Dinner was lovely with great authentic foods and flavours and the bar was a refreshing option and not something you find everywhere for places of this size.  Book it and enjoy the friends you will make whilst there!…",5.0
This Riad has a nice location if you don't want to be close to town.   Warm welcome and helpful staff.   Interesting rooms and interior but needs a good clean.  Bedroom seemed quite dirty too.  Some issue over drinks when came to check out and staff got quite excitable which left a bad taste.   Wouldn't stay again. ,3.0
"I find it difficult to rate this hotel because some things were good and others disappointing. What we liked: the friendly owner, the view on the palmeraie, the decorations, the size of the room, the cleanliness, the terrace. What we like less: the location, not actually in Ouarzazate but 4 km for the town on the other side of the river, the fact that a lot of things (the shower, the toilet, the chairs on the terrace) were lose or broken and the bed that was not very comfortable.  We stayed for one night, which was okay, but we would not return.",3.0
"If our trip to Morocco was an unforgettable experience, it was largely because with have met Hassan. His riad exudes enthusiasm, love and respect for his Country. It's a place where you can really learn a lot, just trust Hassan and his extraordinary family.  Concerning the riad itself, it is very nice and clean, convenient for those traveling by car and ideal for eating traditional meals. See you again with happiness and good health, inshallah.",5.0
"I woke early and watched the surrounding fields coming to life, from the roof terrace.  After a great meal and comfortable bed, with tidy room and lovely hot shower, breakfast included a great chat with Jilly, the English co-owner.  She clarified so many questions we had about our experiences in Morocco so far, as well as having lovely cats for my daughter to stroke!  I look forward to returning when I come back to Morocco!",5.0
"Very much enjoyed my one night stay at this hotel.  Was arranged by the Morocco excursions tour company, but overall everything worked out well.  Ate both breakfast and dinner at this location which were included in the package deal.  Both meals were satisfactory. My friends and I purchased a bottle of wine during dinner and it turned out to be quite over priced, but other than this it seemed the value was present at this hotel. This riad had all sorts of Moroccan charm and a great lookout from the roof.   The staff seemed interested in keeping their patrons happy. Would stay again.  South of the river in  Ouarzazate.",4.0
"友人の紹介でここに泊まりました。中に一歩足を踏み入れてから、あまりの美しさに驚きました。モロッコの伝統的なリヤドで、壁に飾っている装飾から部屋に置いてある椅子、出していただいたお茶の器まで、ひとつひとつがとても美しいです。街の中心からは少し離れていますが、静かで過ごしやすい所。オーナーはとても気配りができる方で、滞在中全てが快適でした。旅行の中で、こんな特別な滞在が一日くらいあってもいいのではないかと思います。  I stayed here because my friend had recommended me this place. i was so surprise when I entered to the riad...how beautiful it was! The traditional decolations on the wall, beautiful chair in the room and antique tea glasses...everytthing in this riad is so beautiful. It is not in the city center but very quiet, good for staying. The owner of the riad was full of hospitality and I was so relaxed staying there. I'm sure this riad will make your journey special!!",5.0
"A very cute Riad on the other side of the bridge from downtown, so you have to consider transportation if you want to get to the souk (open air market).  The people there are exceedingly friendly and accommodating.  If it is important to you, there is a hammam very close by, walking distance.",4.0

Very nice riad with a typical berbère decoration. Perfect for families but also for group of friends. they organize some trips to the desert and all around ouarzazate.  Everything is clean and the kitchen is always open. A bit far from the center which is perfect to relax in a quiet place,5.0
We certainly would not have found this on our own . Our guide booked it and we wondered where he was taking us on the drive through the back streets of the town . The rooms are very good and fortunately they serve dinner as we were a long way from any suitable restaurants . The dinner and breakfast were both very good . The staff were most helpful,4.0

"We found this small hotel in the Routard Guide en route to the desert.  One of our extended family was unwell after the long drive and needed looking after quickly.  After two days rest and cossetting, we reluctantly went on our way, sustained by simple good quality food and accommodation, among people with big hearts.  Our journey was greatly enhanced by our, all too brief stay, and we would love to go back for a longer break next year.",4.0
This riad sits nicely over a small grove of palm trees and gardens.  The staff took us in after another riad canceled our reservation and bent over backward to make sure we had a good impression of Ourzarzate and Morocco.  The food was nice and we had a room on the roof with a beautiful terrace.  It is possible to hike up some high rocks without difficulty or have a wander around the gardens.,5.0
"A very nice and comfortable riad at the edge of a southern neighbourhood of Ouarzazate. We felt very safe and at home here. Some friends and family walked in and out of the hotel - very wonderful - while we were eating a very nice meal, made by Hassan, one of our hosts. Sometimes the staff knew what we wanted, without us asking for it! Our best hotel in Morocco. Definitely want to go back someday.",5.0
"Dar Barbara, at the edge of Ouarzazate is a true oasis of peace and quiet. I hadn't planned on staying there, the CTM bus was held up by an accident on the pass and reaching my planned destination was out of the question. A friend made the reservation for me and I was told to phone upon arrival. At one o 'clock at night I was picked up from the bus station by 4 wheel drive by one of the staff, and 15 minutes later I was in a very pleasant, beautifully decorated, spacious room. Wonderful views of the oasis in the morning, and a very good breakfast on a sunny terrace in the morning. Homely, friendly atmosphere. In fact it was so good, I decided to stay another night. Good walking to the lake. Thoroughly recommended!",4.0
Great Hotel in Ouarzazate with a true Moroccan feel to it. Thee decoration with traditional and beautiful. The food is very good and tasty. The team at the hotel was very welcoming and very helpful. Cannot fault anything! Will definitely recommend this hotel for a short break!,5.0
"I was only booked to stay two nights but ended up staying a whole week. Very welcoming hosts, in a beautifully presented Hotel. Jill and Hassan went above and beyond to look after me as did all of the staff and it made my stay a truly enjoyable experience. I was cooked a full feast every day, and there was no problem catering for my vegetarian diet. My room was very comfortable and clean with a really great en suite shower. The roof top views from the Hotel are nothing short of exceptional and the side terrace catches the morning sun and is a great place for breakfast. If you are heading towards the desert it's a great place to stop at along the way.",5.0
"We enjoyed a very nice and confortable stay (one night) at Jilly and Hassan's. They were very friendly and supported us in every request we had. The Riad is very nicely decorated, the roof terrace has great views and the food was very delicous. In case we will come to Quarzazate again, we will definetely repeat our visit. Unfortunately the center of the town was a few kilometres away, therefore a rental care (as we had) is recommend to get around.",5.0
"This is where we stayed our first night in Morocco. Our guide recommended it and even called ahead to have the heat turned on in the rooms. The staff was wonderful and extremely friendly.

There, Bahsini the waiter make us laugh a lot while he was serving us the tasty food cooked in the same riad. After, he offered us to be our guide in Ouarzazate and we have fun visiting all the beauties in this city. The riad is cozy and typical decorated. The views from the upper floor are spectacular, it's possible to see at the same time the far mountains of Atlas and all Ouarzazate. The owners of this beautiful riad make our stay one of the most funniest days we expend in Morocco. Wish to come back in this riad in the future. Absolutely recommended for families and traveling with…",5.0

One of us had a really bad head cold and the cook provided a very professional and effective head massage that really relieved the symptoms.  Amazing service!  Highly recommended.",5.0
"We stayed at Dar Barbara two times during our trip in Morocco; the first time after being put in another ""good"" hotel by a bad travel agent. The Riad is very quiet, clean and has good AC. The food is excellent, and Hassan and his family are very friendly and make you feel at home immediately. The only slight disadvantage is the location which is a bit off the city center; but as most travelers use Ouarzazate as a layover (there's not much in the city center anyhow), this is a minor thing.",5.0

We were asked when we wanted dinner, when we arrived in the dining room there was a fire going, how wonderful & cozy it felt.  We were served a wonderful cream of vegtable soup.

I had not been well during my trip (food and water poisoning and general sharky service) and the landlady, Jill, made special arrangements for me to be allocated a very quiet room where I would be able to rest and ensured a very plain meal and breakfast to be cooked for me. The hotel is owned by an anglo-moroccan couple who have successfully managed to balance an authentic Moroccan atmosphere with the standards expected by western tourists, and from staying in approx 6 hotels and riads during my visit, this is no easy task to manage (see my other Morocco reviews!!!!)

The riad, situated just across the river in the Berber village of Tadja, provides a comfortable location for sleeping, consistently excellent dining experiences, and an excellent location for visiting with friends. I am certain it will be my home-away-from-home each time I visit this region of Morocco.  The riad architecture, designed by Hassan in the style of his great grandfather’s riad, is gorgeous… with beautiful trim designs and traditional style.

Breakfast can be taken on the roof terrace, in the dining room or on the side patio, depending on the weather. Evening meals are authentic Moroccan and are taken in the dining room where there is an open fire for the cold weather.

The riad is situated on the edge of a quiet village a couple of miles from the city. The location is very peaceful, bordering an extensive palmery/agricultural area where life goes on in the same fashion as it has for hundreds if not thousands of years. This area offers plenty of gentle walking or exploring over many kilometers leading eventualy to the banks of a wide river course or further on, the shores of a well established reservoir.

We were welcomed straight away by the owner Hassan and his staff, who remembered my travelling companion from her stay there a year previous. We were very warmly greeted and immediately relieved of all our bags and shown to our room. It was large, well-kept, and very nicely decorated. Very clean as well.

"We did not plan to stay at Dar Barbara but were taken by our desert guide who suggested it. We haggled slightly on price but the for the price we paid the rooms were great - large rooms, large showers, good dinner and breakfast, warm log fire, and helpful staff.  There was some noise at night but nothing which was out of the ordinary relative to the other hotels. I think it's great for a stopover but if you intend to stay longer in ouarzazate then perhaps might not be the best place to explore, given it seems to be slightly in the outskirts (then again I'm not sure you'd want to stay that long in ourzazate).  You will need a taxi to get to the bus station, but the staff are very helpful and arranged a non-expensive taxi for us.",4.0

"My son and I were booked into this hotel by our tour operator.  We were travelling in May (low season) and the hotel was nearly empty when we arrived in the evening.  The rooms we were given did not have functioning air conditioning (temperatures were near 100).  We went back and forth with the front desk who assured us they would send a ""technician"".  One and a half hours later they finally admitted that the air was not working and gave us two new rooms on a different floor with new wall unit air conditioners (why not these rooms to begin with as the place was empty.)

There wasn't much hot water. This is a transit hotel for coach parties and maybe that's why there isn't too much effort from some staff.

All in all discasting. The pool area was o.k., but not very cosy. Actually we booked half-board, but we decided to go out for dinner, which was the best thing we could do.

Eventually it turned out that there were no other rooms available in any other hotels and they 'magically' found me a room after about 2 hours of trying to sort things out.

"We stayed a week here, and were pretty happy overall.  I will list the things I liked things I didn't.  LIKES: food is fantastic, the views are amazing, centrally located yet isolated in a very sparse place, safe grounds, amazing pool, knowledgeable guides, family and staff are fantastic and as kind as you could want.  ISSUES: the sheets were scratchy, beds hard, the room was very, very hot (c.28 c at night) there was not enough shade, the room was expensive, and the water was frenetic.    Please keep in mind that I went in the height of summer, and it as often over 40 Celsius outside.  Everything dried or was drying.  Water is scarce.  If you walked on the pavement you would get a 2nd degree burn.  I can imagine that our room would be quite comfortable and these problems might not exist other times of the year.  It was difficult during our stay, and so I mention it.  My rating would be 5 stars if the a/c issue, the shade, and the bed comfort issues are fixed.  It's so close to perfect, but these changes need to happen my opinion.    …",3.0
"We stayed a couple of nights here in February 2020, having spent a coup,e of nights out in the mountain villages we wanted to be in town and experience a bit of the city. It is in walking distance to the town centre and close to the airport. The room was lovely and clean, comfortable and with a clean bathroom. Breakfast was very good for a couple of euros extra. The staff were all really helpful and kind. It is slightly noisy at night as the road is busy but I think you would get this anywhere in town and we wanted to experience a bit of the bustle of the city so this was to be expected. Otherwise all was very good.",5.0
"At the end of November you should pay for heating, I had booked a room without and it was chilly. My friend had a room facing the street and got all the sunlight during the day, so her room was much warmer. You get what you pay for... Otherwise the room was good and clean, hot water in the basic bathroom. Breakfast was very good and the location convenient being close to the bus station from where you can also catch a grand taxi to Marrakech. Not too far to walk to the center and even to the Kasbah Tafarnout.",3.0

"The only bad experience i have had in morocco so far! Arrived Ouarzazate at around 9pm, we thought we would go to the hotel directly and check the condition first, the reception who i think was the son of the owner gave us 4 different prices which were higher than booking.com (with/without heater and with/without breakfast), and wanted to confuse us that those were lower than booking.com. Anyway i told him we’d do the booking thru booking.com right away so we could rate our stay later, this horrible person told us he would cancel our booking and he had the right to do it. So i asked if he was being such a mean person and forced us to pay the price he wanted, he said YES. I told him i’d rather sleep on the street than being bullied like that. Moreover i wouldnt feel safe to stay in a place run by such a horrible person. Anyway he said if we refused to pay the price he wanted, then we needed to get out. I told him i would write him a very nice review and then he thrilled us that he would call the police and he had cctv as evidence. I wonder what police could help him with us just standing there being bullied. Anyway we found another very nice place to stay later, lower price with heater, extremely good service and location, honest people who would even take us to local place for dinner later. In conclusion, I wouldn’t recommend anyone to stay here but any other hotel.…",1.0
"Great service and an welcome with open arms. The rooms are very clean and luxurious. Nice bathroom and hot water to shower. For a small extra fee you can have a room with an airco or, as I did, ask for a fan you can use. There is always at the reception so you can always reach someone.",5.0
"I made a reservation for two rooms with a/c for 5 people. When I arrived, no reservation, no rooms with a/c. They convince me to take another rooms and untill that was ok. The problem was the rooms was poor, no a/c, dirty, noisy and MORE EXPENSIVE than I booked. I didnt realized first and I took coz I had no other places to go, but then they start to charge even more: some touristic tax around 2.5EUR per person per day. Incredible how can they try to grab tourists. If you are not marocain, dont go there. Its a trap!!  PS: the breakfast is poor and old food",1.0
"It's an adult hostel with perfectly acceptable fittings. There is an additional charge for A/C, and you will have to ask for additional supplies.

Unfortunately we were only given a small portable heater which did not work properly, so the night was very cold! The room underneath ours had an airconditioner working all night which was really loud. So I advice anyone who wants to stay here in winter to get a room with heating (we asked for one, but only got the small heater).

Thank you very much, will definitely recommend this place. Hotel was good, AC, breakfast, Hygiene, everything very well. ",5.0
"We stayed here 3 nights to break the journey from the desert back to Kesh.   The hotel is near the supratours drop off point, and the grand taxi and local bus station is just a 5 minute walk away. Handy for gettng to Ait Benhaddou,   It's a good 5 minute walk to the local square, but the neighbourhood around the hotel is a quiet local one and pleasant to walk around.   The hotel has a cafe on the ground floor, where you can have breakfast. Service was good and the breakfast was nice. The cafe did get a touch noisy one or two evenings as we stayed in a room on the floor above, but it certainly wasn't rowdy.  The internal doors of the hotel do bang quite loudly so we could always here people coming and going.   The room itself was very clean and the shower was top quality. Good…",4.0

"It was nice to stay a couple of nights in a hotel with loads of hot water, a shower that actually drained, and a very clean room. We were lucky that the hotel was quiet while we were there and most of the rooms empty; the echo inside the building amplifies all sound and the few other guests we encountered were the source of a lot of noise, not because they were being loud but because of the echo and the thin walls. It's a 20 minute walk to the centre, which is entirely manageable. We picked this place because of the free parking spot across the street; we rented a car during our stay, though not from the company associated with Marmar (they quoted us much higher prices for no reason - we decided on a smaller can rental agency, most are situated on the main street in the centre…",4.0
"First of all, the room is great: spacious and clean. The toilet and shower is an actual bathroom that's separated from the bedroom with a door to close. The bed is super comfy with the firmest pillows. We've been traveling in Morocco for about 5 weeks now and have stayed in hostels, riads, hotels, and airbnb's, and this is the best bed we've slept in. It was a bit cold at night, but there was already an extra blanket in the room that we used and it was fine. we nearly missed breakfast in the morning and the kindest gentleman ever offered to take breakfast up to our room to enjoy! Talk about great customer service, that guy was so nice I wish we had gotten his name! We stayed here only one night as this was just a stop on our way to Mhamid.

"After my initial arrival in Marrakech and some time getting acclimated to the exciting country of Morocco, I realized that it was time for the obligatory visit to the desert and camel ride. I took a bus over the breathtaking High Atlas Mountains to Ouarzazate, and spent three days exploring the film industry there and in the historic walled ksar of Aït Ben Haddou (Lawerence of Arabia and Gladiator, for example).  Hotel Marmar provided a very comfortable and place to stay, and a good base for my exploration. The location is excellent, just a few blocks from the Supratours Bus Office and the main taxi stand for both Grand and Petit Taxis. I also enjoyed grilled kabobs at locals joint of El Bahja (and made a cat very full and happy). Another night I feasted on Chevreau M’Kalli,…",5.0

This is a handy spot if you're hoping to spend a bit of time checking out the city. Parking is adjacent to the hotel. Room was not enormous but had ensure and everything was spotless. Breakfast was basic but very adequate and it was not expensive to supplement the meal in any local restaurant. At the top of our experience was the friendliness of the staff and how accomodating they were. They were more than happy to speak English which was a big help given that we had one word of Berber which we slipped in as many times as possible when appropriate. (Spelt how it sounds-shookran which means thankyou). I reckon we'll be back in the Hotel Marmar. ,5.0
"We stayed one night in the hotel while travelling around in Marocco at the end of October. The hotel is situated outside the city centre on the road to the airport. We did not mind as we were travelling with a car and therefore could do trips to the center any time. The room was clean and comfortable. The AC did not work, however. And the level of noise from the street was quite high at night when you needed to open the window to get some fresh air. Overall, it is a very decent hotel with a great price/value ratio. By the way, the breakfast was yummy :)",4.0
"We picked this hotel solely because it's within walking distance to the Supratour office in Ouarzazate.  It's amazing how Ouarzazate differs from most other cities we visited in Morocco.  It's extremely quiet and not nearly as populated.  Getting a taxi here is not as easy as we thought!   It's very affordable.  At the same time, you get nothing more than a bed and a decent shower.  (No AC if that matters to you).   There is free wifi in the common area but the staff turned off the wifi before midnight when they went to bed.

What's more, they're wonderfully cheap (breakfast included), and the owner is very friendly and helpful. The hotel's 5-10 minutes' walk from the town centre. We had a balcony and there's also a flat roof to watch the sunset and admire the mountains from. Ouarzazate is mostly a modern town, but there is a fantastic Kasbah, and it's a calm, laid-back place where no one tried to sell me anything and the locals we met just wanted to help us. I recommend the Hotel Marmar and Ouarzazate as a perfect place to base yourself while exploring the south of Morocco.",5.0
Excellent after 20 years we found again the muslim hospitality. The owner and their workers are heirs of arabian tradition and a lovely friendship. We change the route to come back and surely if we return to ouarzazate we will come back again. Unfortunately the road is quite loud. To find it arriving from Marraqueix on the first roudabout (the movie place) turn left and straight on till you see the spot on the right.(ithe spot is not too visible),5.0
"For a one star hotel it sure acts as a 5 star establishment. Sure, It doesn't have the facilites or the bling, but all-in-all it's just amazing.  We were picked up at the bus stop, welcomed by a complimentary tea and quickly booked in. I only had to show my credit card - they didn't check it or anything. ""We trust you,"" they sayed and we were given a room. I must admit - for the price they asked I was expecting some rather sleazy establishment - boy was I wrong.  The rooms were newly built and spotless clean. Not a single thing wrong. The bed was king sized, the blankets warm and soft. Cashmere.  The room was simple, but looked really nice. Rooms are decorated by moroccan tiles and lot of work has been put into details. Service was excellent - the two brothers who run it are…",5.0
"Stayed at Marmar hotel in the beginning of January. Hotel seems to have just  been built, but not completed. No air-con and TV in a room, empty places for some furniture. The most terrible was sleeping there - really cold! no heating, no air-cons. we put on all clothes we had and took all blankets they gave us, but it was not enough. and also it is a challenge to take a bath!   breakfast is ok. The staff is helpful, they arranged us a car with a driver for 2 days, and we visited aid ben haddou, skoura and neighbourhood of the city for 1300 dhm. WiFi is available in a lobby, but in our room connection was poor.  As a location to explore the surroundings the hotel is a good option.",3.0

Also, the breakfast that's included is the best breakfast we have had in Morocco during our three week stay and superb coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice!!  The hotel can also provide you with car rental service at prices that beat any other rental place in town.  Strongly recommend this hotel - you will not be disappointed.",4.0
"We traveled from Marrakech to Ouarzazate looking forth to go to the desert in Mhamid. I guess Ouarzazate and Zagora have been changing quite a lot recently since they are no longer small towns in the middle of the desert.   The hotel is practically new, the price is really affordable and the location is amazing considering the bus station (5 minutes walking) and other buses companies. They also offer a car rental service which is incredibly good. We payed 35 euros per day for the car; it is possible to drive from Ouarzazate to Mhamid in one day and return. The trip and the landscapes really are worthy of a sudden stop (just be careful of the narrow way.  The two guys in the hotel were more than welcoming and offered us tips about taxi prices, how to drive to Mhamid. They gave us…",4.0

"Amazing family-owned B&B with wonderful hospitality. We will absolutely be back to Ourzazate and we will always stay here. The building is new and beautifully designed and hand-crafted. Everything feels cozy and comfortable yet refined. It's a perfect mix of modern comforts and traditional culture. The staff is incredibly attentive and sweet and knowledgeable about the local culture. They welcomed us with tea and cookies. The food (both dinner and breakfast) were delicious and they were very accommodating for the vegetarian in our group. The style is traditional Moroccan home cooking and we are so glad we tried everything even though it sounded a little strange.   The beds are very firm, but we did not mind. Also be prepared to climb stairs! The lobby is on level 0 and the guest rooms are on floors 2 and 3. The dining area is level 4 and the rooftop terrace (which is beautiful and so pleasant) is level 5. In the rooms there are convenient outlets everywhere, modern TV, climate control in the room, and a nice hair dryer.  Overall a very wonderful experience and I can't wait to return!…",5.0

My family and I stayed in this Riad while on holiday in Morocco. The Riad was amazing! The view from the suite room was breathtaking. The staff was very kind and the owner was very attentive. We traveled with two small children (19 month old and 3 month old) and the accommodation was ideal. They provided a crib for my daughter and extra bed for my son. The room also has access to the tetras from which you can have your meals overlooking the beautiful view. If you are interested in a staycation this is the place. The food was also very very delicious. I definitely recommend this accommodation if you are ever in Ouarzazate! We cannot wait to go back some day.,5.0

"We had a suite with a nice view, the suite itself being average, and the bathroom was ok, with the usual problems with taps not working properly and water not draining from the shower, but this is common in Morocco, in our experience. The real problem was with the neighbourhood, as the hotel is far from the centre and not in a nice area. Everywhere there are unfinished houses and nowhere to go. But the worst thing was the smell. We arrived around 7pm on a warm day and the smell of rubbish and sewer was very intense. We sprayed some parfume in our room and close the window to make it bearable. The dinner was nice but not memorable. Overall, you can find a much better place for the same price in Ourzazate.",3.0

The decoration is beautiful, from the ceilings made of wood to the paintings on the walls.   We had our dinner and breakfast there and it was delicious. Cherry on the cake, they have an amazing WiFi connection which was convenient to catch up with work.  Not sure how much was the price as we took a package from local travel agency but I highly recommend this place",5.0
We had a night here to break our journey to Marrakech after a walking trek in the Jebel Sahro. It was an excellent return to comfort. We had a superb suite of rooms with a desert view balcony.

We relaxed in the balcony, watching the stars, drinking tea, listening to music and we had a calm and beautiful time. After that, the owner invited us for dinner...

I was lucky and had a small terrace off my room, which meant my washing dried quickly. The hotel did offer a laundry service as well, which was reasonably priced.  The gardens and pool area are great and well maintained. We ate all our meals outside on the verandah, a comfortable spot in the early evening or first thing in the morning.  Although I didn’t use the pool, other members of the group said it was lovely.  The food was sensational - every member of our group raved about how good it was.   And, as everywhere in Morocco, too much food.  Really generous amounts. It was hard to resist just one more serve of everything that was placed in front of us.

Laila was there to welcome us and show us around the house, which was truly beautiful , decorated in authentic Moroccan style . The room had space to spare for two, with large closets and  bathroom. The grounds were beautifully landscaped with lots of fruit and decorative plants in bloom. And the pool, one of my favorite memories of Morocco. There is one other thing I have to say about Chez Laila and, don""t get me wrong, I love Moroccan food , but when Laila asked what we wanted for dinner we all requested something other than tagine. I will always remember the fish with lemon, cream sauce we were served that night. If you are looking for a place a stay near Skora I would look no further than Chez Laila. Comfortable rooms, beautiful grounds, nice wine selection and French cooking.…",5.0

The house was so pretty and the surroundings serene and beautiful. The room was comfortable. Laila and her staff were very courteous. No complaints at all.  A small point but carry your own soap if you like a quality bath soap. But its still good value. A good stop to refresh ourselves and amazing food. ,4.0

Garden with pool was especially nice as it is large with 6 or more sunbeds plus additional seating area as well as the dining area. If you were to break your touring up with a few days relaxing by a pool this would be the place as the pool did not feel enclosed like other riads. Very nice food selected by the dish off a menu rather than the more usual fixed price 3 courses offered elsewhere. Not particularly cheap but allows more choice if you only want one or two dishes. And with a nice bottle of…,5.0
We had a night here on our 5 day tour. Nice and comfortable room with plenty of space. Staff were quite friendly and served us very generous portions of dinner and breakfast. Swimming pool looked very inviting.,5.0
"Just one night at Chez Laila on our return to Marrakech, but a very enjoyable and comfortable stay.  Laila made us very welcome with tea and home-made biscuits comfortably seated on her covered terrace overlooking the swimming pool in the garden.   A sunset excursion into the nearby Oasis at Skoura (a World Heritage site) produced some fascinating pictures of the old kasbah bathed in glowing light. Excellent dinner followed with good Moroccan wine on offer.  Water for a hot shower was a little hit or miss due to the shower settings, but I managed :-)  A much enjoyed stay!",4.0
"Chez Laila in Skoura is the perfect place for reposing a few days in beautiful Morocco!. Everything works out fine chez Laila: the rooms are spacious and luxurious, the garden is beautiful, the pool tempting, the food is delicious. In short: Chez Laila is FORMIDABLE!",5.0

"We arrived at this hotel after a few days in the desert and were exhausted. This was the perfect location to relax and recharge. We only stayed one night but the beautifully appointed rooms and excellent service made Chez Laila very memorable. We had dinner in the restaurants and all of the food was outstanding - a cut above your regular set menu, with much more flavorful and creative food. We were there in winter so didn't enjoy the pool/outdoors but they looked very nice as well. This is a great stop if you are travelling through the desert or between major cities - an unexpected hidden gem that will not disappoint.",5.0
"We stayed at Chez Laila for 2 nights with 10 persons during our 8 cycling trip from Agadir through the south of Morocco to Marrakech. Mme Laila is amazing and goes out of her way to accomodate her guests. The Kasbah offers everything you wish for: It's authentic with impeccable hygene and the service is personal and very kind. Meanwhile Laila offers exceptional Moroccan food, which she cooks herself. It was the highpoint of our cycling trip. Laila, merci de nouveau!",5.0

"This amazing little Dar in Skoura was the calmest place we stayed in Morocco. We stayed as part of a 4 day desert trip, opting here instead of Oarzazate and we are so glad we did! It's not in the centre of town, and it was nice to go for a walk along a quiet street after a day on the road.  The owners made us feel so welcome, and we had one of the best meals here that we had on our entire trip!!! Not to mention the spread for breakfast was beautiful and perfect for hitting the road the next day   I wouldn't hesitate in telling anyone to stay here!",5.0

"Skoura is quiet but Chez Laila is well signposted. We were a little disappointed to find the pool and front path were being repaired. So as we were only staying for one night our visions of lying by the pool were quashed. However, the house is delightful and spacious and there is a lovely first floor terrace with views over the palmerie and mountains and once we had mint tea and cakes up there we were very happy. Dinner and breakfast were very good and the staff were attentive and polite. Hostess Laila was charming and we would come back again without question but we might check beforehand if the pool was working.",4.0
"We stayed here for 3 nights and initially were concerned there wasn't enough to do in Skoura. However we had a great three days with a mixture of relaxation and adventure.  On arrival it wasn't quite as we had imagined as the pool was being filled up and we had the feeling it was the start of the season and our French isn't great so it was a bit tricky to start with. However, chez Laila's charms quickly grew on us as we relaxed with our mint tea and homemade biscuits.    The room was lovely even though it wasn't huge and the house is very old and traditionally built. There is a roof terrace that we went up to for stunning views. The only fault with the food is the size! Very generous portions, but this wasn't really a  problem as it was all delicious - the best food we had on…",5.0
"We spent one night at this cozy place in December. The bedroom was large with one queen size bed and three single beds with separate shower and bathroom. The dining room doubled as a very comfortable living/guest area with a crackling fireplace. Food was good and plentiful. Laila was a great hostess making sure we were happy with the accommodations. When our A/C/heater failed, Laila called the electrician and gave us additional electric heaters for the night. Thank you Laila for a great stay!",5.0
It was our first time in Skoura.  Chez Laila was a good choice.  The atmosphere and food were excellent.  Laila is a wonderful host and we can't wait to return again.  The market at Skoura on Mondays is well worth a visit and the Palmeraie is magical.  Chez Laila has quad bikes and cycles to hire as well as a pool so one could definitely spend a few days there.  Highly recommended and very good value.,5.0

"WOW!!! Chez Laila is located in the Palmeraie of Skoura. Beautiful and quiet. We felt extremely welcome and very relaxed. We came from the touristic Marrakesh and were on our way to the desert (Merzouga). Finally we could breath and feel like princesses... Nice rooms, GREAT food and perfect hospitallity.

"I and my fiancee came to the Ecolodge for 4 nights. We enjoyed a lovely stay, the location was beautiful and the service impeccable! Very warm welcome, good selection of drinks, the pool (opened day and night) was particularly relaxing. The price was worth it.  The activities proposed seemed fun and the money went directly to the locals involved - we took part in the cooking lesson; the teacher was very nice and helpful (however, we couldn't choose the dishes to cook, which was a bit of a letdown).  This would be a 5 stars review, if not for a little accident: the last night a group of 20 people decided to have a big party until 3/4 in the morning... They were loud, rude to staff and didn't care when we asked to at least lower their voices/music. It was a letdown to see the direction not to take action about this... We and other people had to wake up early and the director knew this.  That being said, a big thank you to the service staff - especially to Hassan and the breakfast waiter! Your kindness made this stay very worthy!…",4.0

Stayed here for a night on the way through Morocco.  The Ecolodge is nice and quiet since it is located a bit of a ways from downtown Ouarzazate.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  The rooms were comfortable and breakfast was excellent.  What more could one want.,5.0

Despite our late arrival the staff were so helpful and got us settled and fed well. The food is really excellent and much more authentic than you might find in a restaurant in the town.   Our hut had insect mesh on the windows so we were able to have the windows open to sleep which was wonderful.  the space was incredible, beautiful and spotless. The shower room was simple and everything that was needed with better water and pressure than I have had in many large hotels.

The same pattern is continuing to the receptionist which is very confident that his job is more than perfect and you should be happy that he allowes you to breath the same air.

"We booked for one day and extended to 3 nights. If I had more time, I would stay longer. Amid (that manages the place) was a sweet heart, looking after everyone and calling people by their names. I loved meeting the other travellers (all very interesting people). One of the high lights for me was to spend time with some of the cats, in particular the black and gold kitten . He was the most loving kitten I have met and made my heart warm while away from my pets. If you like animals, you will enjoy this place. I bought lots of cat food as a gift and would love if other visitors would do the same.   The bedding is basic, the showers are good with abundant hot water, the stuff is friendly and the place quite beautiful. We hired a taxi some of the days to go visit neighbour towns.…",4.0

During the whole night, we had a peacock and roosters yelling all night as well as Morrocan music playing from a radio when apparently “there was no music allowed after 1 a.m.”. We didn’t sleep all night. Secondly, we were told every customer had a FREE “welcome tea”. At the checkout, the owner charged us the tea. Thirdly, we had dinner at their restaurant and at the end, staff brought us “Moroccan pastries” (more like industrial biscuits) that we didn’t even order, as “a gift from the house” and at our surprise, which they also charged us at the checkout.

We wear so cold in the morning (in May) even though we had two covers each.  2. We couldn’t sleep because of animals (peacocks, Chickens) yelling all night long  3. The owner is a THIEF! We were so tired when we arrived at night after the road from Casablanca that we were too lazy to go to the city to have dinner so I asked Hamid one of the guy who works there the prices of the only dishes left (tajines) because they made 2big plates for all of us before we eat and he told me I will ask the boss but…",1.0
"The staff was friendly, and the place is nice, BUT... To begin with, we were put in tents even if we were supposed to sleep in huts. Tents got noisy because of animals walking around it and music coming from the city, but ok, an interesting experience for one night. The really NEGATIVE part of the stay is that the owner charged us with things we never ordered, such as the dessert (clearly overpriced: 16eur for 8 industrial small cookies). He got rude during the discussion and ruined our stay. Plus, he treats his personnel as garbage. Such a pity.",1.0

We arrived at the Ecolodge after arranging for a standard room with the owner over email. Everything was confirmed and we showed up at around 2pm. We were only greeted by a member of staff after interrupting him on his phone. The staff member had no idea that we had booked a room via email and the owner was not on site (not an issue but the staff should have been made aware). We were eventually showed to our room, however, no information was given to us and nothing was requested of us at the reception.

We had 2 nights staying in the very cute African hut. The room was spacious for our family of four. The beds were very comfortable.

"My stay at this camping left a bitter taste in my mouth. It was a dark day to an overall beautiful holiday. The staff was very unfriendly, and very rude. I've never been treated so bad by ""hospitality"" staff before. All I can say is : don't come here, every Dirham spent on them is a waste. The place itself actually looks nice, but that's where it ends. The showers are hard to control as well. And I also saw on of the staff members throwing rocks at peacocks several times.",1.0
The owner of this place forced us to pay double because we checked out little bit later. Communication is very sad. We stayed in a berber tent for the same price as our tent. Although we could not enjoy camping because a friend of the owner was watching us continuously like thiefs. He was unfriendly to the animals too. We were not allowed to make noise or music or campfire. No worth for the money,1.0

A simple Maroccan breakfast can be ordered for 25MAD. Dinner reservation is also possible. The place is located little outside of Ouarzazarte and isn't reachable by public transport.

We didn't reached there soon, because we did a long road trip, and the owner twisted a little bit the nose when we ask for something to eat. But they prepared a meal for us. When we asked for fresh water, she said they hadn't. They only had water from a fountain. We asked Ice to join the water. The water was half gassed, and did not kill the yield. The ice smelled horribly of fish. Wi-fi only in a common room. The beds were full of dust, as if no one was there a long ago. There was no toilet paper when we arrived...

The ground to pitch our own tent was gravel/stones but they have a garden which we cooked our dinner in.  Nice to not have to sit on the gravel again to cook.  The restaurant wasn't open due to it being low season and us being the only guests, but we did get a look inside the large Berber style tent and it looked great.

Adil is knowledgeable about the area and its history, we went on tours (to nearby oasis and kasbah ait ben haddou) and he was the guide. We got a room and it was squeaky clean.

You can also go walking down to the river through the palms.  It's a nice and quiet area, we took a lot of walks and didn't get any of the hassle you sometimes get in the big cities of Morocco.  Oh, and the food is incredible!  Adi has a great cook.

The camping is basically a little village of these characteristic but at the same time definitely high confortable and big tents...

Great as a stopover if visit around Ouarzazate, but you will need a car to get around. Was fairly quiet, although a tour bus did bring a party for a one-night stopover.",4.0
"This is a very expensive hotel that looks incredible on arrival. Rooms are cheap and poorly finished.  Bathroom door, doesn't close, towel quality small and thin. Unfortunately you can hear every amorous sound from your neighbors. The food substandard buffet. I think if this was first introduction too moroccan food you would be very disappointed. On positive side at least hot water and bed comfortable.  Would not recommend staying.",1.0
"This is a new hotel and as you would expect, it is very nice.   The staff is very professional and the rooms are spacious and clean.   We were here in the off-season and were the only guests.   We enjoyed three nights with breakfast and dinner each day.  The staff gave us all of their attention and made our stay perfect.      Yassine and Abraham were our primary contacts and we let them make the food selections each day.   We enjoyed a wide variety of Moroccan treats and truly enjoyed the Ksar Ben Youssef experience.     The location is on the outskirts of Ouarzazate, providing a quiet setting.   The sunrise in this location is stunning.   Keep in mind that this is at least a 10 minute ride from the city center.",5.0
"The room was correct, quiet, spacious enough, with a small fridge and fairly clean. We would have liked one or two chairs and a wardrobe to put our backpacks / clothes on.  The shelf in the corner was too small.  The girls at the reception are nice, Houssine, the boss, likes to talk a lot !   The restaurant is ok but the breakfast is top notch !   Never had a problem to park the rental car outside of the hotel.",5.0
We just returned from our recent stay at this property and we were 5 Guides from the High Atlas Mountains  and we had a  First Aid Training in Ouarzazte city and we had an amazing stay at the Rose valley hotel and we really enjoyed everything from the moment we arrived at night 23h00 the welcoming was great the staff were accommodating and fresh breakfast every morning the rooms are very clean with hot showers.We definitely coming back and it's highly recommended.

Overall a nice and basic hotel just for one night on your way to the desert",4.0
"Clean, convenient hotel close to the local bus/taxi station with good service and helpful staff.

Very convenient and inexpensive hotel close to the airport. We stayed here the night before our tour. The night staff was very helpful and friendly. We had a quick breakfast the next morning. The food was good. Room was clean. We had a little difficulty with heat but otherwise the hotel was good.,4.0
"A clean and proper hotel, with friendly staff, located directly across the street from the Bus Station and close to numerous restaurants and cafes.  Very good value for the price, credit cards accepted.  No elevator, thus unsuitable for anyone who cannot climb stairs.  Wi-Fi was very slow and frequently failed completely during my 3 day stay. Heating in the first room I was assigned did not work.  If you don't need internet, it's a great place to stay.",4.0

Heaters, hair dryers and extra blankets in the rooms made this stay really comfortable. Special shout out the the staff Houssiene and Abderrahmane for their incredible service, super fun.",5.0
"(+)  Hotel basic and nothing fancy, more like an inn. Room modern and clean. Ouarzazate is just a small town so I guess this hotel may be one of the good choices. Good to serve as an overnight stop on the way before entering into the desert. There is no lift just like most of the other riads/hotels. Staff very polite and friendly who were kind to help us carry our heavy suitcases up the stairs to our rooms. Bed comfortable.  (-) Poor wifi. No television.

"Very convenient to Gare Routiere (but far from supratours). Pool is an oasis with equal mix of shade/sun throughout the day. This is midrange--not the cheapest private room, but nice. Nice hot showers with strong water pressure. I stayed in budget room on ground floor with tiny windows, no natural light. Kind of depressing lack of decor. Satellite TV, but almost all in arabic. Wifi very spotty except in lobby. Overall ok. I wouldn't take front desk advice on Ait BenHaddou. 300 MAD rt high--you can get it for 200 with 1-2hr stop if you negotiate hard. Night time more.",4.0

"Very decent hotel. Looks like it ia newly refurbished when we visited in nov'17.the location is good and bad, depending on your preference. It is right in front of a main? bus station and big taxi rank. So it is easy access but also not the very nicest of neighbourhood. The service in hotel is good. Food is very affordable and you can have it in your room. Not to forget that the food is delicious. Only problem i had that in the breakfast menu they listed amlou but delivered something else. It was like a curd kind of thin but i don't know what it was called. There is no lift in the hotel. There is a cafe in the hotel too where many people come and it got very noisy the first day. Later i found out it was the match when Morocco qualified for the football World Cup so I can guess…",4.0
I booked two triple and one single room for the family. Rooms where clean and good size. The air con was working fine. The rooms had a fridge which was useful for keeping our drinks cold.   The hotel has a onsite cafe at the front of the building. We ordered dinner (pizzas) which was delivered to our room.   The cafe also serves breakfast which was okay. I think a few mistakes were make in translation. Breakfast was served till midday. Expedia doesn't give the option of including breakfast in the room price and it had to be paid separately.   Going back to the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel and the cafe are reasonably priced. I would happily stay again if I was to ever return to the area. ,4.0
"This hotel is ideally located for the local transport and well equipped with good air-conditioning, a fridge and new television in each room. The pool is a nice addition and the staff are more than helpful. The hotel also boasts a cafe right at the front of it and is not far from anything worth seeing. If you are concerned about the low price, don't be, this hotel is a clean newly built operation that puts it ahead of much of the Ouarzazate competition, especially for this price.",5.0
Good budget option hotel in the entry of Atlas mountains. Nice and friendly staff ready to help.Moroccan hospitality is present all the time at this hotel. Ourzazate is a magic town where you can breath the dessert atmosphere anytime.,4.0
"It's a really lovely pleasant, neat and tidy hotel with a good amenities. Close to the local bus station as well as approximately 1,5 km away from the CTM main bus station in Ouarzazate. Opposite the hotel you will find some low-budget take away sandwich bars as well as restaurants. From the rooms you will have a wonderfull panoramic view over the Atlas Mountains. The rooms have air-condition, but is seems better just to open the window. It has downstairs a cozy and chilly lounge room where you could rest. The highligh of the hotel is definitely the swimming pool that after a long day in the hot summer temperatures and dusty paths of Atlas mountain range you will dream about geting into the water to chill yourself. I would call it a gateway into the mountains or a good base when…",5.0
"Fantastic hotel located nearby Ouarzazate center and 5 minutes away from the airport. The suite is spacious, clean and has a nice traditional Moroccan decoration. Enjoyable sitting by the pool area where the restaurant and a nice bar are located. Breakfast was very satisfying with a variety of choices. The overall staff is extremely respectful, professional and very welcoming. Thanks to Aicha at the reservations and to all employees and managers.  I will definitely recommend and hopefully come back soon.",5.0

I would have preferred local cooking.  friendly staff ..",3.0
The hotel is decently comfortable.  Rooms are of adequate size and clean.  The included breakfast was predictable and what you would normally find in Moroccan hotels.  It was a comfortable stay and enjoyed but for an incident.  The hotel has a pool side bar that was serving liquor to European light-skinned tourists but declined to serve me despite repeated requests.,3.0

"Awful and old furniture in the room. Hair dryer better not to touch it or risk a electric shock. Plumbing, like the existing in an very old house very is in very bad shape. Reception desk attention poor. The pool plenty of mosquitoes. Definitely not to be recommended, fortunately stayed only one night.",2.0
"I can see why this hotel gets bad reviews. Yes, the internet reception is frustratingly slow. The rooms are a bit old fashioned. The plumbing could do with a total refit, when the pipes rattled it was like being in the engine room of the Titanic!. The water was an odd colour and you wouldn't want to sit in a bath, but showering in it was okay, and it was always hot!  On the plus side, the pool was always clean and well kept. The breakfast was also good, the freshly squeezed orange juice was to die for and the French baguettes were always freshly baked. My room was comfortable, and the only annoying thing were those aforementioned rattling pipes which were very noisy.  The staff were friendly and most spoke broken English, but the majority spoke French and always greeted you with a  - ''Bonjour'' or ''Ca va'' every morning!…",3.0
"This hotel is in need of a refit and a rethink. The staff are friendly but relatively useless. The rooms are old and dirty. The plumbing is in desperate need of repair, you could not guarantee hot water or in fact clean water. Some of the showers I had were in brown water. The food is less than good and there is no room service of any description. There is very limited internet in reception but it is slow and unreliable. If you have the choice, go somewhere else!",2.0
Rooms are ok but quite worn. The pool was full of dead mosquitoes and nobody cleaned it during the 3 days we stayed there. We ordered massage which was rather expensive and not good at all. The rooms in the first floor are with windows to the walking path and everybody can sneak to your room. Location is ok. Apparently there is a popular nightclub just next to the hotel - didn't bother us though.,2.0
"Geez, what a filthy poor place. Our tour company cocked up and we had to stay here. If I'd known about it I'd have asked if it was possible for me to sleep on the street whilst being attacked by wild dogs as it would have been preferable. Service bad. Rooms bad. Food bad. Bad",1.0

Dinner was the worst we've had during a whole week in Morocco - no local food and no real selection (boring spaghetti, and salad with mayonnaise, no desserts except for whole banana, apple or orange ...) . Breakfast was poor as well if you don't like sweet . Too many stairs. Wi-Fi only in the lobby.",3.0
"This hotel is good and well equipped, the beds are comfortable.   We would rate it as no more than a 3 star.  The rooms are a long way from the main hotel and spread around, worse still, there are lots of steps (both up and down) to get around this hotel (no lifts).  The dinner and breakfast were basic.   Seems to cater for tours so if you are traveling as a couple it may be a bit like a production line.",3.0
We stayed here for one night before travelling on. We had a lovely breakfast of porridge and pancakes. The orange juice was very refreshing. The bed was very comfortable but only supply one pillow. The shower had plenty of hot water. Very quiet at the hotel when we stayed. Only a short walk into the town centre.  There is a night club beside the hotel but I can honestly say that I never heard it all night. The staff could not do enough for you.,5.0
"We spent 1 night on a tour. The hotel is a bit old but very clean. It was good for 1 night but I wouldn't stay there longer because there are better places to stay in Ouarzazate. We enjoyed the food because we could eat something else than ""tajine"" (after 6 days!), their buffet was very tasty and their was a lot of choices. Breakfast was good. Staff really friendly.",3.0
"I stayed in this hotel on my way from Agadir to Merzouga.  The rooms are okay but the AC would not cool below 29 Celcius (84 F).  Since the telephone was not working, I had to walk to reception in another building (500 feet away).  Internet access is ONLY in the reception (another buidling).  Bar men would not budge from behind the bar.  I had to walk up and get my own drinks.  Pool is oaky but not great.  The hotel staff, in general, donot seem to be enthusiastic about working in the hotel, and therefore, do not expect service from the hotel staff.",1.0

We stayed there 2 nights and we found other hotels in Morocco whith much better value for the money.",3.0

However, racing out of the hotel at 6:30 a.m. to go visit a nearby UNESCO site caused the fellow at the desk to ask us to pay for our parking... we quickly explained we would be back for breakfast after seeing the sun rise at Ait Benbaddou.  Dinner and breakfast were nice... not overly special, but certainly not bad.  A good choice for a short stay.",4.0
"We arrived early and our stay seemed off to a bad start when we had to wait quite a long time to get to our room. However, to make up for it, we were given a free breakfast before we then got to the room, which we thought was a nice gesture. The breakfast was also one of the best ones of our stay and the roof top terrace is lovely. Rooms are simple and clean, value for money was decent. Staff was very friendly. Only downside might be that it's a bit of a walk to some of the attractions / restaurants. However very convenient if you're traveling by bus and/or don't want to spend much time in Ouarzazate itself anyway. Less than 10min walk to the Supratours station which was ideal for us. ",4.0
Had to book two rooms last minute and Bouchra and Younes were so great and accommodating. This location has parking around the side and a basic good breakfast in the morning.

Two out of three of the staff at reception (the third didn't speak English) were really helpful and friendly. Beds were comfortable, hot water plentiful. The location is good, about 5 minutes walk from the centre, and near the grand taxi station. It's on a big street, but our room faced the street and there seemed to be no noise at all.

"Just don't even think that what you will get resemble the photos. The hotel has probably seen better days, and although the bedsheets are clean, everything else is dirty, dusty and really unwelcoming. Breakfast, on the other hand, was kindly served in a little derelict sunroom up in the terrace, and honestly was not bad.",2.0
Friendly and welcoming staff. Nice and cosy rooms. Appetizing breakfast served on terrace on the roof. Rooms have air conditioning which you can use if outside is cooler. We rent a room with the view in the street. Apart of street view you have an amazing panoramic view on mountains.   ,5.0
"Stayed in Hotel Azoul for 2 nights just before Christmas.  The rooms have heating, which was wonderful, as the nights were very cold.  The bed was hard, but very very comfortable.  The guy on reception was extremely helpful and friendly, gave us useful recommendations.  The breakfasts were good - egg, bread, lots of jams and honeys, cucumber, tomato, teas and coffees, and hot pancake.  All served with a smile.  We had a room overlooking the courtyard at the back - not a fabulous outlook, but very quiet at night, and we both slept really well.  Loads of hot water in the shower, and all very clean.",5.0

Very nicely cooked, great seasoning and true Moroccan flavors for €10/pax. ",4.0
"Solid, comfortable hotel, well designed and maintained. Close to the center and to the medina. The staff is very friendly and helpful.   BUT!!!

"I highly recommend Hotel Azoul.  The room was very comfortable and the owners do everything to make you feel welcome.  We happened to be there the night of Eid, the end of Ramadan and an important holiday; they had a beautiful dinner prepared for us and served on their lovely rooftop terrace.  Excellent value and an excellent place to stay.",5.0
"I would highly recommend this hotel if you are passing though Ouarzazate because of its good location, great value for money, VERY comfortable rooms, excellent food and friendly staff. It genuinely deserves 5/5.   To expand on the above: It is located on the main road just outside the town centre which made finding the hotel very easy. It is next door to a couple of car rental offices (one of the reasons we picked this hotel as we were returning our car in Ouarzazate). There are a few restaurants to eat nearby but it is only a cheap taxi ride into the town centre where there are plenty of other options (and obviously much easier if you have a car too).  We opted to eat dinner at the hotel because we were tired and had already explored Ouarzazate during the day. Dinner was served…",5.0
"Me and my partner stayed in Azoul for one night on our way from Merzouga to Marrakesh. We were welcomed by a lady receptionist who was absolutely lovely and made us feel welcome.  One of the advantages of this hotel is its location about 15 - 20 minutes walk from the main city square where you can shop and eat.    The room we were allocated in was modern, clean and comfortable, it also had the necessary air cond and wireless.  The breakfast on the rooftop terrace was delicious, I especially loved the honey.

"We had a lovely stay at Hotel Azoul. Clean, modern rooms, and very helpful staff! We even got to leave our luggage there, the one night we spent in the desert. Good, standard moroccan breakfast, and a great view from the terrace. The dinner they offer is A LOT of food (about 5-6 courses), all moroccan food, and really good! The location is a bit outside the center, but still close enough, and the taxis are cheap. The guy in the reseption was super nice, and at the time, trying out every room in the hotel, to check that every room were comfortable and good for the guests.  Recommended!",5.0

"We spent a couple great nights here before and after our desert tour. The rooms were comfortable, breakfast on the rooftop terrace was beautiful, and the reception staff, though short on English, was very friendly.

"The room was very comfortable and clean. The breakfast at the roof top terrace under the morning sun was a great enjoyment. The chef prepared us a very delicious late night dinner ( nothing but tajin, but prepared in a very delicate way) for 10 euro each and we felt well worth the money. Great compliment to the chef.  However, the hotel has some distance from CTM bus station. need to take taxi (for like 10 or 15 dihram).",4.0
"This was a great place to stay, and both my traveling companion and I wish we had spent more time in Ouarzazate.  We visited Casablanca, Fes, Ouarzazate, Marrakech and some of the sub-saharan desert.  The two things we wish we had spent more of our time on were seeing the Sahara, and hanging out in Ouarzazate.    My recommendation... Don't spend a bunch of time in any of those other places, they're all the same.  Pretty dirty, people trying to get your money anyway they can etc etc... but Ouarzazate is different.    Hotel Azoul is very nice.  It is in a decent location (about 5 minutes from the center of town), but the hotel itself is very nice, and parking is available for 10 Dirham (one Euro) per day.  The breakfast is quite good, and the ladies at the front desk are very…",4.0
"We stayed for two nights on our way to a desert trip and another night coming back from the desert.  The hotel has a nice rooftop where breakfast is served and, if you wish, you can have a hotel dinner at reasonable cost. Another advantage is that the staff don't mind you bringing in a bottle of wine from the supermarket to have with your meal. (An important attribute in Morocco). The staff are very helpful and obliging.  The rooms are clean, but a bit on the small side, but the hotel is quite well priced. Like anywhere, you get what you pay for. The bathrooms are a little small, but adequate and clean.",4.0
We stayed in the soleil room in hotel azoul for three nights--very tastefully decorated with nice view from the balcony.

About halfway to the bus station.",5.0
"We stayed one night. We have been sent there by the owner of another riad (we were looking for a place with heating because night is cold in December in Ouarzazate even if it's sunny). It was a good choice. The place is clean and nice (despite the flags at the entrance). Our room was nice and decorated, a lot of rose petals everywhere; the bed was huge (triple)!! and there is heating and TV. The price was very good for the service, only 42 euros for a double room. Breakfast was good (standard Moroccan) but was on the roof terrace!  If you find a place at the sun it's not too cold but having breakfast in a cold place is a bit annoying.",4.0
"The room space was pretty tight, but comfortable for it's intended purpose (sleep and leave). The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Breakfast on the balcony was pleasant. WI-FI was sporadic. Not a lot of options in Ouarzazate and this would not be my first, but a pleasant enough place.",3.0

Reception was very friendly, hotel and room very clean and the breakfast on the lovely roof terrace was definitely okay.  Definitely recommendable!",5.0
"This is a mediocre small hotel. The room was reasonable, and so was the bathroom and breakfast. Although the hotel advertised wi-fi connection in all rooms, the only place where it was available was the lobby, which can seat only 3...  The staff did not even attempt to solve the problem. The hotel is inexpensive, so it is ok for those who are looking for a place to sleep and move on.",3.0

Meals are served on the rooftop terrace, which gives terrific views of the town and surrounding countryside. Breakfasts are substantial. We opted to have our evening meals in the hotel (most residents choose to eat out), and the dinners are substantial, well cooked and well presented. We were asked to choose our options from the menu in advance, which was not a problem for us.  Wifi is available in reception only. The staff are efficient, friendly and hospitable. However,…",4.0

From the minute we walked in the staff, each one of them so friendly, welcoming and helpful.  We had planned to stay one night and ended up spending three nights.

The two are run by the same people -  rooms very modern, clean and very nicely decorated.  The staff was efficient, welcoming and friendly.  There is parking in front of the hotel.  The only possible drawback is that it was not in town (its before the town as you drive in from Marrakesh), but its a pleasant walk (about 700 m or so) from the town.  Ended up staying another night as the hotel was exactly what were after - simple, no fuss, friendly accommodation.",4.0

There was a lovely pool that looks like it would be very inviting in the summer months.  The owner was very kind and responsive.

"tip about Ouarzazate, Morocco? Ouarzazate is a city in southern Morocco that is known as the gateway to the desert. Situated at the meeting of the valleys of the wadi and Ouarzazate Oued Dades (from the High Atlas) that make up the Wadi Draa and downstream of their confluence, it is the hub of a vast region of southern Morocco . Ouarzazate evokes both the southern foothills of the High Atlas and the nearby desert. His countless casbahs adobe, mountains and arid plains, valleys and lush oasis of palm groves and villages of red earth or ocher are the charm of this region and give it a tourist attraction.",5.0
We stayed here for two nights and it was lovely. The hosts are fantastic and offered good advice on places to visit locally. We took the advice and had a great time. We ate dinner there on both nights and the food was excellent as was the breakfast. The rooms were spacious and very clean.  We will definitely visit again,5.0
"I was very unhappy with my experience here, mostly due to the difference between expectation and reality.   let me start by saying that the owners, christophe and noelle, were very nice and noelle is a talented cook. the views are quite nice and in the summer there's a pool that would be great. rooms are clean if incredibly simple.   however, this is not a bed and breakfast, not even a typical moroccan style riad. this is a campsite, primarily for RVs, with a few guest rooms that they also rent out. this is an important distinction!!! for example, we had no soap in the bathroom. not even hand soap. the shower water was freezing cold. there was no comforter on the bed, just a blanket- and the sheets were rough. most of the guests drove in with their RVs and used the communal bathroom facilities, so the reviews here will likely be skewed  based on that.  overall if you're looking for an RV site, this may be a good option for you. however if you're looking for a bed and breakfast don't be fooled, this isn't the right choice! PS the breakfast is not included. also wifi is spotty and doesn't work reliably from the rooms (only from the restaurant).…",2.0

"This riad was at the back of a hotel and lacked the ""home stay"" atmosphere which we have got used to in Morocco. Having said that, the room was good and well appointed in a charming old building. We were well looked after by Rachid who spoke very good English. We had supper at the riad which was served at a table just outside our room. Soup, lamb tagine, slighty tough yet very tasty followed by date and apple tart. We slept really well here and it was very comfortable. Breakfast was a bit disappointing, yoghurt from a plastic pot and not home produced orange juice. There were stunning views of the Atlas mountains from the wonderful terrace, and an old kasbah to explore.",3.0

As in February it gets cold during the night, it was good to have a heating in the room.",5.0
"This was the fourth stop on our honeymoon road trip. We were quite unwell and exhausted by this point so we spent our time here relaxing. Unfortunately it was quite hard to get to because of an unexpected closed road and we almost got lost.

The room was pleasant but we asked to move rooms because we noticed quite a lot of ants in the room. We felt that because it was the low season the rooms hasn't been occupied for a while. We were moved to a room up on the terrace and we were very happy with this and there were no ants. Staff were very helpful and gave us free bottles of water.

The view from the rooftop terrace was out of this world with views of the valley and lower Atlas Mountains. The staff were all extremely caring and helpful along with the local villagers as well. The village itself is a time capsule that was a privilege to experience. Compared to the city of Ouarzazate, Dar Bladi is a relaxing paradise.",5.0
"We spent 1 night but we wished we could stay longer! The room was big and nicely decorated, in traditional Moroccan style as all the place. Great, well equipped bathroom, good quality toiletries. Loved the detail of complimentary fruit and water in the room. The service was always friendly and helpful. Wifi was unstable (but this seemed to be endemic in Morocco).   The food was really great! Both dinner and breakfast were abundant and delicious.  Beautiful views from the terrace over the city and the mountains, it must be lovely in warmer months.   Dar Bladi is the smaller and more traditional accommodation linked to the ""posher"" Dar Daif in front of it, where the reception is located. Mind that both are located in a tiny village outside Ouarzazate, so you need to drive there and it's a bit difficult to reach at first (especially if you do not know that is the same property as Dar Daif, there were many signals advertising Dar Daif, but none for Dar Bladi, the name we were looking for). After checking in Dar Daif, you need to walk about 5 minutes trough the village to Dar Baldi. We found that walk very scenic and a nice addition to the experience, but I see that can be 'scary' for some, and not ideal if you have walking difficulties as the path is uneven and there is no possibility to reach the hotel door by car. We have read some complaints about dirty paths, smell of farm animals, being too isolated... Well, it is a village. Not for everyone I guess. We loved our stay.…",5.0
"Beautifully restored riad in the middle of a sleepy kasbah village just outside of Ouarzazate. Dar Bladi is the homely, authentic sister to the more ritzy Dar Daif (from the same owners). Very tastefully decorated. Delicious breakfast and dinner (with a surprise performance by a traditional Tashelhiyt Berber singer). Fabulous views from the two terraces. We got our welcome tea (with delicious fresh Moroccan pastry) on the terrace, and on a hot evening it would be great to dine there too. The two patios offer a lot of room for relaxing and reading. Very friendly and helpful staff. We had a great stay here.  Parking, reception and luggage handling is all done at Dar Daif which is only ~50m away. Staff helpfully emails beforehand with travel tips and the question if you want to have dinner in the riad, which we highly recommend (esp. the tajine with lamb chops and quince). When we left, our car had been washed and we got a nice little gift to boot. Avoid staying in uninspired Ouarzazate and go for Dar Bladi instead.…",4.0
"Overall had a lovely staff at Dar Bladi. It is smaller and more traditional accommodation that is linked to the more modern Dar Daif in front of it. We were able to use the services of Dar Daif which was nice. Overall, I appreciated the privacy and simple styling of Dar Bladi more. It is is a bit out of the city centre of Ouarzazate in a smaller village but has great views. The downside would be getting around without your own vehicle.

We ended up having a buffet dinner for the same price somewhere else.  The access to the riad goes through a very scary path, deep inside the neighbourhood where it's located. It includes climbing up a muddy hill, and going through a tunnel under somebody else's house. To our luck, it was raining when we left, so you can imagine. It's ok once you are in the house.

There isn't much to do in the area but the hotel was comfortable with a nice pool area and it was a nice change from Marrakech for a few days.

There was a bit of a miscommunication about the price of it but it all worked out. Thank you Riad Bouchedor and Ibrahim, I would recommend this place if you are passing through the area and looking for a place to stay.",5.0

"In all fairness to this small Riad, I was expecting to be placed in a 5 star hotel from the tour I booked. My travel agency, Trip.Me, did not deliver on my one-night stay in Ouarzazate! Luckily it was only for one night. The hotel is comparable to a bad Hampton Inn in the U.S. There was no TV in the room, nor small body towels to bath. The bathroom was so small that water hit the sink while running! The food was horrible and there was a roach on the coffee container at breakfast. the door handle leading from what fronts as a dining room to the pool area was broken. If I could give this hotel less than 1 star I would. How it got a Trip Advisor Excellence Award is beyond me. That said, the staff were friendly, hardworking and quite kind...a staple of Morocco.",1.0
Its a small hotel with no elevators. Staff was very welcoming and the staff lugged my baggage up the stairs. Its a small hotel. The rooms are kind of spartan but clean and  comfortable. The bathrooms are clean but just functional. The architecture is very local. Food is just average. The swimming pool is small but lovely. It was too cold to swim but the ambience is nice.Its a hotel with a lot of heart. I loved it.  The red flag is the location. Nothing around.,3.0
65 year old on 2 week visit to Morocco.One night stay. Clean and decor very nice.Staff were extremely pleasant. Room and bathroom were spacious.Breakfast and Dinner were included and were both very good. Service was excellent.  Location is not that great but we were tired and just needed a good night's rest.  Would highly recommend,5.0
For starters I was travelling with my 60 year old mother. We went to Morocco for her 60th birthday. We arrived at Riad Bouchedor and upon checking in we had to walk up flights of stairs to get to our rooms. There were 3 full grown men working at the front desk and not one offered to help my mom with her luggage. When I asked them to help her they seemed angry at my request so I just carried her bags up for her. Once in our rooms one bed was wobbly and had no pillow or blankets. The shower had no holders for the shower head and there was no warm water. We then had dinner and the service was terrible. I had to ask for utensils and then wasn't given any so I had to go get my own. No drinks offered and literally next to no service. The swimming pool was empty and not functional. The area wasn't close to anything. This area had lots of unfinished homes and had absolutely no views. I have travelled around the world for 15 years and am not scared of much yet there was no way I was going to walk around this area at night. It didn't feel safe and was visually ugly! To end this review all I have to say is any issue I brought up about my room or the staff to the management was blatantly disregarded and I felt disrespected. DO NOT STAY HERE!…,1.0
We stayed here as part of a tour and were a little disappointed about the location as originally we were meant to be staying somewhere more central.  That said the Riad it self is lovely and the staff are quite accommodating.  Out of our group we ended up in one of the rooftop rooms where there is quite a large terrace which is nice to have a wine at night. The bathrooms were also fitted with the fossil vanities that we had seen back in Erfoud.  There is also a really nice walled courtyard and pool area which we made use of the afternoon that we arrived before dinner.  Dinner and breakfast were fine and pretty standard for Morocco.  Nice stay,4.0

"We had a lovely stay in this riad. From the pristine, sparkling (and clean) swimming pool, where we swam away the afternoon heat, to the friendly and warm service at dinner and breakfast, to the nice shower in the room, to the good food (and we even had a couple of customized requests for the food that they accommodated), we had a great stay. The room itself was a bit on the basic side, but it's what we expected. It was nice to have a room on the roof level.",5.0
We stayed here for one night and the Riad itself was clean but location is far from the town proper. They had a pool but the water was so cold for us to even swim.. The employees were friendly and helpful. I loved there chicken tagine. They had a rooftop area for gathering but they need to clean the throw pillows and chair covers. You can tell it hasn't been cleaned in a while.,3.0
"We stayed here for 1 night with a group tour and were very pleased, we all sat by the pool & had drinks (that we had bought ourselves before arriving) as there is no alcohol served here, the room was comfortable with air conditioning, our room  was at the back & overlooked the pool, we had dinner which was really nice & sat by the pool for breakfast which was also good, the staff were friendly.",5.0

"A strange hotel that seemed to work well. We were on the top floor with excellent views around. The rooms were good and the staff and service excellent, they carry the cases up the stairs for you as there is no lift. The food was very good, though still not sure on the soup? Alcohol is not served, as in many places in Morocco, but you can buy it outside and take it in with you. enjoyed our stay here.",5.0
"While this Riad is a little out of Ouarzazate (it seemed to me), it is beautifully appointed and has everything the weary traveler could want.  We had a room with 3 beds, a shower and heater/AC. It was a great space with enough room for 3 people to unpack and move about. The hotel is new, so everything is clean and nicely done. The bathroom shower was wonderful. The hotel offers dinner and breakfast, both of which were plentiful. The dinner was sooo much food - a soup, eggplant salad, huge tagine and dessert. All were delicious and filling. Breakfast was a mix of breads, yoghurt, coffee and teas.  The wifi was good at first, although we did get kicked off every now and then and have to reset. But beggars can't be choosers. I would definitely visit this Riad again if I am ever in…",5.0
"Beautiful Riad in Ouarzazate. A really warm welcome by Brahim, such a nice brother. It is true that is located a bit far from the centre, but in the other hand it is very quiet and silence predominates during all night. Not just Brahim was really kind and attentive. The staff in the Restaurant was amazing too, always smiling and diligent. The food was good and abundant. The room had the heating on by the time I was accompanied there. Courteous gesture towards the guest. I did not have the opportunity to meet the owner, but I would like to congratulate him for having such a lovely Riad and moreover to have such fantastic staff and look after them. I wish you all at Riad Bouchedor the very best and hope to be back in the future.",5.0
"We stopped here as part of a 4 day tour, after a day in the mountains, on the way to the desert. The Riad is on the edge of a new housing estate and overlooks a building site, but after a full day of travelling we didn’t want to leave anyway and fully enjoyed everything within the Riad walls instead. There was a set menu for dinner, which was well cooked, tasty and plentiful. We had to pay for drinks, which was fine and the staff were friendly and attentive. We stayed on the top floor and there was a little seating area there on the roof which was lovely, outside the front of the Riad there was also a seating area with cushions and a roof which was lovely to sit and relax in. There was a nice terrace and pool area out the back but the pool was under maintenance so we couldn’t…",5.0
"After a long but magnificent day in the Atlas Mountains, arriving at the Riad Bouchedor at dusk was like arriving at an oasis.  This riad is honest value and the ambience throughout was very relaxing, very Moroccan. Lots of mood lighting with candles adorning the stairwells and public areas. There are a number of different public areas both inside and out. Hint: The rooftop sitting area is a lovely space to enjoy a glass of wine in the evening. Although it was the wrong time of the year for a swim, the pool and surrounding outdoor area would be very inviting in the summer. Our room was perfectly clean and we enjoyed a great night's sleep.  The meals were great value and we really enjoyed our Turkey, Egg, Date and Sesame Seed Tagine. Breakfast was a buffet with plenty of options.…",4.0

Wasn't sure what to expect because of the location. Very pleasantly surprised. It is a stunning little riad. As soon as you enter there is a feeling of serenity.

The food was delicious. Highly recommend.,5.0
It is true there's nothing really around the Riad. However I enjoyed my stay for one night and had a room on the top floor with a shared terrace. My room and bathroom were spacious. The lock was broken on the door and the guy at the front desk came right up and it was fixed immediately. Also I dropped my converter/adapter and the front desk had a loaner so I could charger my devices.   I had dinner at the Riad and enjoyed the soup and turkey tagine. The service was spot on. Also I had a good breakfast there the next morning.  The reason for the 4 stars is the wifi was the worst and never really worked while I was there. I usually don't stress out about the wifi but I was heading back to the states and needed to check on flights and check in. This couldn't be done until I got to…,4.0
"Do your homework people. We stayed here while on a private tour and when the agency suggested this, like a good little travel researcher I looked it up and thought it looked good and gave them the thumbs up. The staff here are lovely, our room was very nice and there is a nice pool (although the water was still a bit chilly for a dip when we were there). The food was... interesting? As previously mentioned there is not a really a choice with the food and they just bring it to your table. They really are trying hard to please however there is no overcoming the location. You really are in the middle of nowhere. We are travellers who like to take a stroll and find somewhere to be among the locals but there was no doing this here. Such a shame as we drove through the town to get…",3.0
"We loved the Ambiente of this riad. The pool was nice and plenty of bats flying around at night which was fun to see. The terrace and the pool area were nice, we spent a significant amount of time during our one night stay here. It was booked by the tour company we used, Desert Explored, and they have done a great job finding places where they thought we are comfortable. The only negative I would say is that our room had a weird smell, but that may have been from the air freshener. Overall, we enjoyed our time here. ",4.0
The riad was fairly basic. It was clean and comfortable and nice to be able to cool off in the pool. Food was ok and the staff pleasant. The view from our room was a pretty grotty back street. Nothing to write home about though. ,3.0
"The ambiance was unexpectedly lovely in the middle of a gravel pit-like setting.  People were very friendly and the food was excellent.  However we had arranged for separate rooms for each of our group of 6 and we got 5 singles and a double.  We made it work, but that was somewhat disappointing, and the only one of our many riads and hotels to fumble our reservations.  European style twin beds made it workable, but still not ideal.",4.0
"We spent one night on our way back from the dessert. Very nice, clean and quiet. They served an excellent dinner. The only negative point is its location because it is located at the far end of the city. Not recommended for people interested in walking around the city and absolutely recommended for people looking for a quiet place to rest.",5.0

"If you don't want to have supper at the Riad or for some reason want to be in downtown Ouarzazate then this is not a good choice for you.  Its location is relatively far from the city center and any attractions.  That being said, it is a very clean and relatively new building. The rooms and bathrooms are nice. Hot water may take a while to get to the top floor rooms, at least it did in ours. Unfortunately the WiFi is sporadic and very slow  The meals are simple and tasty and I would recommend that they add fresh fruit at breakfast given the abundance locally.  I was disappointed that the juice tasted like it was a Tang equivalent instead of fresh.  The manager Hassan does work hard to try and insure his guests are happy.  But they need to make some improvements to bring this up…",4.0

Rooms are very nice and clean, very warm (we visited in winter) and spacey, very good customer service in general. We also had dinner there which was quite nice, and breakfast was also good. They have a wonderful swimming pool at the back, although we did not have the chance to try due to winter weather.",4.0

The area of the hotel was quiet and we had no trouble sleeping . Dinner and breakfast were included .

We find out only when we arrive there that the Riad was in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by dirty places and on going construction area. This is probably the worst part of Ouarzazate. We were obliged to get dinner inside the Riad, as nothing is around. The food was TERRIBLE, (2 of us spend night on the Throne), and overpriced; no possibility to choose food, a cold soup, some old fish, and usual lamb, 1 banana for dessert all for 30 Euro (WATER AND DRINK AXCLUDED)!!!

Dinner was underwhelming but breakfast excellent. This hotel and its helpful staff are obviously working hard to be excellent - with a few tweaks it could achieve this.

The room was clean and bed was comfortable. The shower was one those hand-held shower heads but it was mounted at waist level and not overhead.

"We stayed over here as part of a tour and were met with polite friendly people who offered us tea and traditional biscuits on arrival. The town itself has significant portions under construction as part of a revitalisation of the town, with both new hotels and local housing projects underway to provide for the established movie business the area has historically capitalised on.  The Riad is at the far end of the town in an area that is still undergoing work and this is very visible from the upper rooms.

We checked in on our tour of 14 days for 1 night. This hotel was very disappointing. The room they gave us smelled horrible. On top of it the washroom had been used. They switched us to a different room. We needed to ask for toilet paper and glasses. Just a really bad experience. The air conditioner wouldn't cool off enough so needed to open the windows to cool the place off. This wouldn't of been to bad but are neighbors were up late talking.

We had 2 rooms opposite each other on the top floor with a lovely terrace, as part of a 4 day excursion -so couldn't believe our luck!  The pool was the best, with the dining room overlooking the pool so we could relax and watch the children. All the food was of very high standard - again probably amongst the tastiest we had in our 10 day stay in Morocco. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Don't be put off by the location being on the other side of the bridge to town and the surroundings being in develoment- it is definitely worth staying here.",5.0

It's not in the centre of Ouarzazate but in a calm spot 5 min away from the city. The food we had was unusual and tasty, not including anything of tajine or couscous, but a tasty plate of rice with sausages, meatballs, veggies and also we had an unusual salad made with pasta and veggies, and a very tasty sauce. The room was spacious, bright and very clean.",5.0
"Excellent Hotel in a very interesting area. Very kind employees in hotel and restaurant. The food served at restaurant has been also excellent. I wish to thank all of them and particularly HICHAM AND HOSSAINE. I suggest to go there, everything will be fine and very satisfying.",5.0
We really enjoyed this riad. We had one of the suites on the roof and it was gorgeous. The dinner was very nice too. It was really fun to relax on the rooftop and enjoy the sunset. The only minuses: 1. No wifi up on the roof 2. The water was expensive,5.0
"This is an incredible riad. The staff, decor, pool, and dining area were wonderful. It was too bad that it was too cold to jump in the pool. The entire staff: Ibrahim, Hicham and Salah were very hospitable. They wanted to do everything to make our stay enjoyable. I loved the decor and the attention to detail. The riad was very convenient to walk to town where it was very lively as the students were on a holiday. We stopped as people greeted us and tried to converse with us even though we did not speak the language but thier gestures were welcoming. We would definately recommend this place as a haven to rest your feet.",5.0
Pretty riad with great service and excellent food.  The room was clean and the place was good value - room for three (parents plus a teen) with breakfast and dinner for 65 quid.  Location isn't great as the riad is in what seems like a building site - hopefully the surrounding buildings will be finished soon!,4.0
"We stayed one night at Riad Boucherdor in February 2015 on our way back to Marrakech in a snowstorm. The people were very friendly, greeting us with Mint tea and understanding from our long trip from Rissani that day. As we stayed in numerous Riads throughout the trip I will use a standard system so that you may link to other reviews I have made and know what I mean.  Room: Clean and Cozy - we were on the top floor, and despite it being near 0oC outside, the room was quite warm.  Shower: Very hot - this was exactly what we needed after our long and wet day traveling. Wifi: On the top floor where were, the wifi was not so good, but at dinner on the main level the wifi was fine. Food: Both Dinner and Breakfest were quite nice.",4.0
"We stayed at Riad Bouchedor for 1 night as part of a 4 day tour and would highly recommend it. The staff were amazing; super friendly and accommodating from the moment we arrived. When they heard it was my birthday, they went out of their way to make sure it was memorable and it was definately one I will never forget; they put out decorations, sang, served a beautiful cake. It was far beyond what any of us expected. The riad itself was beautiful; really nice rooms and clean. We hope we will have the chance to return one day. We thank all of the staff for their wonderful hospitality and memorable stay at Riad Bouchedor!",5.0
"This is one of the riads that you have the choice to stay at after a camel trek and night in the desert.  We were there for only one night but it was beautiful.  The staff is very attentive.    We arrived late and the riad owner had called our driver guide (now friend) to check on us.  When we got their they took our bags to our room which was on the terrace.   Dinner was a set menu and when we sat down, food just started arriving.   Soup, a Moroccan ""pizza"", and a turkey tagine.  It was very good.  Dinner and breakfast were included in the price we paid to the camel trek company who made these arrangements for us.   If you are doing a camel trek and are given this riad as a choice for your second or third night. Choose it.  The camel trek company we used has it listed as the…",5.0
"I stayed in this riad a few months ago, hosted by the owner Hassan who was very helpful in everything, i like the rooms very spacious, clean beds, delicious food, and a very beautiful pool, the staff including Ibrahim are all amazing, very warm and welcoming. I like this new place and i highly recommend it.",5.0
"The riad is beautiful, clean, moroccan style; the staff is absolutely lovely and professional. The only thing I didn't like was food: at dinner and at breakfast we had something very western, included a terrible icecream. And the menu was fixed...",4.0
"Comfortable bed in a nice room with quiet air conditioning.  There is a pool at the back of the building, an outside terrace upstairs and inside sitting room so plenty of space if you need it.  The view from the back is mainly of construction at the moment (Oct 2014) although there is no noise from this, either as it is a holiday in Morocco this week or because of the way that Moroccans build houses bit by bit.  Wifi is free but very slow and doesn't pick up in all rooms.   Food was nice in the evening, breakfast bread was quite dry though.",3.0
"Our group of 13 people, stayed one night in this Kasbah and we cannot speak more highly of it. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The swimming pool area is inviting, even more after a day’s drive crossing the Atlas. The Kasbah is very modern with all you need. Dinner and breakfast were very good. Definitely will be back next time we visit Ouarzazate.",5.0
"The hotel is a very modern riad. We had a lovely stay. Dinner was good, and breakfast was excellent. very inviting swimming pool after a desert excursion. The staff were excelent and very thougthfull! The only down side was the location, far from the city. You need car to go to and from the hotel.",5.0
"A welcoming spot after a day driving across the high atlas and visiting kasbahs.  The hotel staff is sweet and very accommodating.  They have a wonderful pool area and a lovely patio on the roof.  We stayed on the top floor where the patio is located and had cocktails and watched the sunset.  There are 4 rooms adjacent to the patio.  Dinner and breakfast were fine, nothing fancy or elaborate.  The hotel is too far from downtown to walk so you need a driver or cab to take you to town.",5.0
We stayed here 2 nights and cannot speak more highly of the riad and it's staff. The meals especially the kefta tajine were one of the best of our 3 week tour. The staff are all courteous and friendly. The pool and outside area are very very nice after a days touring. Our room was gorgeous and beautifully decorated again one of the best of our stays. Highly recommended.,5.0
"We overnighted here on our  4 day mountain/desert tour.  The hotel was very pretty and our rooms were extremely comfortable and modern compared to the other riads we had stayed in.  We didn't have time to use the pool, but it would be very welcome on a hot day. Our dinner and breakfast were both very good. The restaurant manager is a real gentleman and goes out of his way to make his guests comfortable. Our experience with the front desk was very good as well. The location was good for us as we were only passing through but it is located out of the downtown area with not much around it to walk to.",4.0
"This was a nice riad on the outskirs of Ouarzazate. My friend and I stayed here on the last night of our 4 day tour of Morocco. Because of its location near the edge of town, it was far quieter than we had anticipated meaning a nice night's sleep. The dinner (which was included in our stay) was tasty and we were able to sit outside near the pool and enjoy the sunset behind the surrounding houses. The wifi worked well in the lobby area and the rooms were well appointed. Definitely a good choice if staying overnight in the area.",4.0
"This is a new Riad and the building is lovely. This Riad was booked for us as part of a dessert tour.  When we arrived we were shown to a very small room with three single beds the room had one window that opened into the hall, no closet or dresser (room to small for one) we turned on the air conditioner no cool air my son went into the bathroom no water!!! We went down to speak with person at the desk he told us the whole town had no water, he also told us the air condition takes awhile to cool the room and that the Riad was fully book so we could not be move to a move suitable room.  We went out to the pool to wait for our room to cool down, the pool is ice cold :(.  Two hours later we returned to room to find it just as hot and still no water.  We again go down to the front…",2.0
"First of all, if you are choosing your riad based on its location in ouarzazate, do not look at the tripadvisor map as it appears to be bang in the centre of town....it isn't (not the first time i have noticed Trip Advisor be incorrect about a restaurant or hotel location in Morocco). Go to the riad bouchedour website and if you are driving, refer to this instead. The riad is signposted from the main road, as is other riads. It is about 5-10 min drive south of Ouarzazate en route to Zagora on the n9 road (cross the concrete bridge and turn left as you enter the centre of another town/village) you should see the sign just as you leave civilization.   Having said that, in our few days stay here using it as a base, most guests were staying only one or two nights before moving on…",4.0
"We enjoyed our stay of a couple of nights here. The staff were friendly. The room was clean and was wonderfully cool compared to the very hot temperature outside. Food was just okay - certainly plentiful at dinner and breakfast, but not the best we've had in Morocco. The views from our room or from the common areas were not great, there is a lot of building happening around the hotel, but this did not detract from our stay.",4.0
"Travellers to or from the Sahara or those exploringing the various Amazigh villages in the region will find this riad a real ""oasis"". Contemporary Moroccan designed new (14months old) hotel with more than a passing nod to Riad-Style. Very comfortable beds that are far superior to most found in riads, excellent airconditioning and a delightful pool to wash away the rigors of desert living ! Meals - breakfast and dinner are on the copious size although not gourmet they are quite acceptable fare. Staff are friendly and efficient and host Hassan Bouchedor (gotta love that name) clearly takes an interest in each guest and has a good relationship with his crew. Certain to return.",5.0
"The hotel was chosen by our tour operator, I'm not sure what I was expecting but was pleasantly surprised with how nice it is. The attention to detail by the staff was excellent, for example the air conditioner had been turned on it our room before our arrival. The dinner we had was lovely and the breakfast is the best we have had so far in Morocco. ",5.0
"We reached Ourzazate in the late afternoon and checked into the riad. We had 1 single and 1 double room for the 3 of us. The double was spacious as was its bathroom. Everything was quite chic and classy. We went down to the pool but the water was too cold to go in. Dinner was a set course meal which was average, and breakfast was a reasonable spread.",4.0
"Our family visited Morocco end of last month.  And this is by far the best place we stayed.  The room was very clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated.  Hassan the owner and his staff are so friendly, kind and very helpful.  Food is absolutely delicious and well presented.  Ambiance was great.  We had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay in this Riad and would recommend it to anyone who is planning a visit to Morocco.",5.0
"Upon arrival to this riad, we were greeted by its warm staff, moroccan mint tea and local biscuits while we checked in.  This was a fantastic start (i had a lot of the great biscuits) and continued to be one for our entire stay.  While it may seem trivial, it's the small touches like this that contribute to a great stay.  Riad Bouchedor's interiors had great character. To the flooring or our bedroom ceiling, it was rather different and cool.  We stayed at the top floor, and they have a nice lounge area for smoking which would also give you a good view of the surroundings.  Definitely a gem!",5.0
The staff was so kind and helpful! The hotel was beautiful and smelled wonderful . The ambiance was just awesome!  The food was delicious! The bed was so comfortable and the room was just decorated beautifully the furniture was so pretty and the lanterns were gorgeous!!  I would go back in a heartbeat!,5.0
"Hassan (the hotel owner of Riad Bouchedor) was extremely generous and welcoming during our stay there. He and his staff went out of their way to help us in a time when we were in trouble in Morocco and I will never forget the generosity that we experienced there.   The hotel itself is beautiful, clean and comfortable and with all possible facilities you will need. The food was fantastic and breakfast was catered for. I truly recommend a stay here during your time at Morocco. ",5.0
"It was at Riad Bouchedor that my friends and I experienced warm Moroccan (Berber) hospitality.  Riad Bouchedor is a gem of a place to stay at, and its owner, Hassan, is a good man.  We were unfortunate to be involved in a vehicle accident during the day, but we were lucky that our guide had Hassan as a friend to help us out. Hassan helped us at the local hospital for a few hours, helped us get medicine at a pharmacy, and let us stay at his Riad for free that night. I will forever be thankful for his help in a foreign land where not many people speak English, especially not the staff at the hospital. Hassan also went out of his way to arrang transport for us to go to the town (40km away from Ouarzarzate) the next day where the police in charge of the incident were located.  We…",5.0
"We adored Riad Bouchedor. The staff went above and beyond, helping us out more than I ever could have asked for. My son came down sick with a fever, on a Sunday when most pharmacies are closed. The owner took us into town and found an open pharmacy for us, translated for us as well. Also, I ended up having some oil problems with my vehicle and they took me to the mechanic that they use and helped us get back on the road again. The rooms were impeccably clean, nice warm showers, and such a beautiful place. Granted there is a lot of new construction surrounding the riad, and it wasn't walking distance to the main sights in Ouarzazate, we would never stay anywhere else. It was peaceful, the dinners and breakfasts were great. And like I mentioned, the staff were so amazing. They…",5.0

"We've found this Riad through tripadvisor. After a few hundred km of road, we're trying to find an original place to stay in Ouarzazate. Something cosy and clean, something beautiful and quiet, with a touch of morocco tradition... Oh and we found it! It is a little far from town center and a bit hard to find though, particularly at night. But we loved it anyway.",4.0
"We stayed there after a long trip from Marrakesh. The hotel was comfortable and the staff friendly. It is a bit hard to find if driving but they were able to guide us over the phone. The dinner (which was part of our package) was good. The pool outside looked nice but maybe because it was winter, the water stagnated and it was unpleasant to stroll near it.",4.0
"The hotel is located at the city limits of Ourzazate, is easy to find, has very nice rooms, and an excellent restaurant. The interior design with many little details is another reason to go there, especially handmade tiles on the floor in very nice colours. We enjoyed our stay very much and can recommend this place!",5.0
"The riad Bouchedor is a small, modest place,  where the meals are much better than those in some other riads and hotels. Our top floor room included a dome on the roof, pierced with star shapes and then glazed. Very romantic to see the sky through these small shapes during a moonlit night. The riad has a larger version of this dome in the lobby. The staff are absolutely charming, including those who do the cooking.",4.0
"Our tour guide picked this Riad-what a great place!  The staff was exceptional, the food delicious, and the rooms really comfortable and clean.  It is on the edge of town so this gorgeous place seems out of place-great pictures.  I recommend this Riad without hesitation!",5.0
"I stayed at Riad Bouchedor for one night during a Viaje en Marruecos private day tour. When we arrived we were greeted with a spread of hors d'oeuvre and a fresh orange and mint drink in the beautiful lobby. A four-course dinner followed. The only thing that surpassed the loveliness of the hotel, with its star-shaped fountain in the lobby, candlelit staircase, and sumptuous rooms, was the friendliness of the staff. Highly recommended.",5.0

"La Bouche d’or is a new riad and well worth chosing for a stay in Ouarzazt, although it is on the edge, rather than in the centre of town so you’ll need your own transport. It is a modern take on the traditional riad style, decorated simply but with understated elegance. Our room, off the roof terrace, was comfortable and very clean.  Furnishing was minimalist, decor un-fussy, with a good king size bed, a cushioned divan and a built in structure for hanging or storing clothes. There were good bedside reading lights and a moderately effective air conditioner to heat the room during our cold winter visit. The bathroom was similarly basic but modern with a stylish treatment of the shower.  Toiletries were limited to packets of shampoo and soap bars. Also stylish was a dome in the…",5.0
"This new riad in what appears to be a new area of Ouarzazate was arranged by our private tour operator. It is a beautiful hotel with great rooms, grounds and restaurant in a town with little else other than Ait ben Haddou (A MUST SEE). The service in the riad was impeccable and most helpful. The deck overlooking the pool was a wonderful place for our dinner.  If visiting Ouarzazate, this is a great place to stay.",5.0
"We discovered this lovely riad when our original reservations where cancelled and we were moved to the Riad Bouchedor; it is a lovely new riad outside of Ouarzazate. We received a warm welcome on our arrival. The riad is immaculately clean, rooms are en-site and well-presented, the staff is warm and welcoming and quick to assist. Riad has a spacious roof deck and a poll courtyard; pool is unheated.   Dinner was included in our tariff; it was equivalent to 4 star dinning. Service was quick, friendly yet very professionals and the 4 course was delicious!!!!  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this riad to those on their why to the dessert or trekking around Morrocco.",5.0
"Nice stop in Ouarzazate, if you want to rest on your way to the dessert. It is quiet , nice pool and terraces. All the people is very helpful and warm. I got seek and they offer to go to the drugstore.  Food is good more international (some times is a good break), specially breakfast that has more options as eggs that you don't easily find around there. The downside if you are staying to go and explore Ouarzate is the location that is in the outside. In my case it was not an issue. ",4.0

"Riad  Bouchedor is built in traditional design with a central fountain where we were greeted with mint tea and cookies (the first chocolate we had since arriving in Morocco).  The pool, decorated with plants, lanterns and umbrellas, was quite refreshing. Our room was on the top floor and had a cupola with cut-out stars to the sky.  Dinner was a treat.  After the starters, we were presented  with plates of tender meat and flavorful sides...a change from the tagines we had daily.  Dessert was a surprise -- chocolate mousse (which we were certain had been made specially for us after making a fuss over the cookies)  After dinner, we climbed the candle-lit stairs to the roof-top terrace for some star-gazing.  A tasty breakfast was served on the terrace overlooking the pool. …",5.0

The whole place was simply a piece of art, tastefully decorated and looked extremely charming and romantic in the dark because of the gorgeous lanterns everywhere.  We had two rooms on the rooftop, they were beautiful, quiet, clean and comfortable.  Just one step out of the door and we were immediately embraced by the ethereal starry sky above.  It was so comforting to be in a nice and new riad like this especially after our 2 nights in the desert.    Staff was great, friendly, polite, helpful and very attentive.

In the summer months when temperatures daily top 40 degrees, either the aircon in your vehicle will be losing the battle against direct sunlight coming through the windows – or you can experience roaring heat like a hundred hairdryers burning on you, if have decided that aircon is not your thing & keep the windows open.

The surrounding neighborhood is not much to see in terms of beauty, but is still a fascinating look into everyday life in rural/small town Morocco.  We watched the goings on from the rooftop terrace and enjoyed seeing the goat herds come in and be fed, chickens running in and out of the house across the way, and the family preparing couscous on their back patio. We did walk after dinner, not far because there were no street lights . The pool and pool area is inviting and comfortable - a welcome dip in the hot afternoon.

"Newly build riad a few kilometers outside Ouarzazate. Its very nice, very good food, only thing is that there s nothing outside, it s a big construction site, so a walk around during the evening or something is not possible. Hassan the owner comes to you to ask you to improve the riads performance by reviewing it (not on TA, but direct) If you need to do a stopover in Ouarzazate this is a good place if you want to stay in Ouarzazate I should suggest a riad or hotel downtown.",4.0
The riad was recommended by Maroc Excursions (strongly recommend) and it was a good 1 nite stay. The food was excellent and the staff was friendly. I enjoyed the beef tagine and creme brulee very much. Very delicious. The wifi network was strong and working well. :) I stayed on the rooftop floor and it has an excellent view of the city.,5.0

Dinner consisted of vegetable soup, rice spring rolls, beef and apricot tagine, followed by strawberry creme brulee.  The breakfast was served buffet-style but was also very good.  We cannot complain about this 5-star accomodation located a few kilometres away from Ouarzazate!!!",5.0
"We stayed here for one night as part of our tour (with Roughtours - also highly recommended).

I especially recommend the rooms up on the roof with the starry dome ceilings and the outdoor lounging space. The staff were attentive and the breakfast was good and varied. However, I do think they could improve on the quality of the dinner as the entree was somewhat lacking. Other than that, I would highly recommend this riad.",4.0

This hotel is only 3 months old and has the perfect combination of Moroccan architecture, modern minimalism, and world class service. The rooms feature crisp white linen that smells of freshness, windows that look out onto the modern pool area, a beautiful shower, interesting fossil stone sink countertop, and all tiled floors instead of bacteria trapping area rugs that many other riads have. I am very particular about cleanliness and this place felt cleaner than my own house.   The public areas and dining area are equally beautiful and modern.

"Riad Bouchedor was part of our desert package tour, the Riad was new and rooms were spacious, well appointed and clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The set menu dinner was delicious and breakfast was European standard fare. The only drawback was that it is located some distance from the centre of town in a new and mostly unattractive surroundings. The view from the roof of the surrounding mountains was great. One minor negative is the soap supplied is not good quality crumbled easily and did not give a good lather as the water in the area is quite hard, but shower and water pressure was good.",5.0
"The Riad had been recommended by a guest house in other area.  It is a new building with a roof terrace, swimming pool and good rooms. The staff are very attentive. There is a small rose petal filled fountain in the central atrium of the Riad.

This is a brand new hotel on the edge of a depressing building site.  It is clean and comfortable but completely characterless. The food is more second class international than Moroccan and the portions were the most meagre we found in a week of excellent food on a tour from Marrakech through gorges and desert.  The tiny lamb tagine lacked any flavour and the dessert was a terrible chocolate mousse (in Morocco?) which looked and tasted as if it had been made from a powdered instant pudding mix.  Breakfast was an anywhere in the world buffet.  Ask your tour planner to find you another hotel.,2.0

The room(suite) was beautiful with small star-like windows in the ceiling and a bathroom which contained a beautiful sink with fossils from the nearby mountains. There is also a roof terasse which had a view over the city. The riad is located in a new part of the city and therefore not close to the city center.",5.0
We didn't want to make the 10 hour drive from Marrakech to the camp in the Sahara so stopped here for a night. The room was very comfortable with a lovely big pool right outside the door.  The back door in the room led up to a rooftop private patio!  The real treasure is the restaurant. Lovely atmosphere and the food (I had pasta) was excellent.  Alcohol is served which is not common due to the Muslim customs. Very good and attentive service both in the restaurant and the accommodation.    The style is simple architecture which seems to blend well with the area. Lovely gardens and water features.  Would definitely recommend this,5.0

I won't talk about the architecture of the place as many people have talked about it in their reviews.

Great service and great food.  As for the hotel, the rooms are nice and quiet. The bed was a little hard for my liking but my husband slept well on it. The shower was great and the terrace above the room was a wonderful place to view the stars on a clear night. The breakfast was nice and plentiful - mostly pastries. The WiFi was hit or miss (just not a consistent signal).  The owner of the hotel/restaurant made sure to make his rounds during dinner to say hello but he wasn’t overly friendly or welcoming like the rest of the staff was.  He did hold our luggage in his apartment while we were away for a night in the Sahara desert which was quite nice. It does sit outside of town quite a ways and my taxi driver had a hard time finding it upon arrival in Ouarzazate.  Overall I would stay here again.  It was quiet, the restaurant was very convenient & delicious, and the staff made sure your stay was great. …",4.0
"It's a bit out of town, but the hotel is so beautiful we decided to stay there a few nights after the Riads in Marrakesh. The owner is a very friendly Spanish gentleman and he built the hotel himself. The room was beautiful and very confortable but quite cold at night, the airconditioning can be converted into a heater and they also provided me with a portable one for the freezing bathroom. The food at the restaurant was really good and the breakfast too.  However... because of the set-up (foreign owner; luxury hotel...etc.) this was the only place I didn't lock my suitcase and 2 hours before our flight out of the country we discovered my engagement ring was gone. It was too late for a police report. I had hidden it in my wallet and then left the wallet in the suitcase. Money was still there.  **We still dont know for sure when and where the ring was stolen, but in general just remember to lock everything in Morocco. Or leave all the expensive things at home.**…",3.0
"It's a very unique boutique property just outside Ouarzazate. Property has only 4 or 5 rooms so book early or you might miss this great property. If you are like us and visiting Ouarzazate just for the Atlas studio, the location is perfect. It's only 10 mins drive from Atlas Studios. It's owned and operated by a Spanish elderly man and service and staff are really spot on. May be best value for money in the area. Pictures are accurate so be assured. We had dinner at the restaurant located in the property and food was delicious. It server variety of Spanish and Moroccan dishes. Drinks are priced well. Would recommend to all. Book in advance as very few rooms.  Road leading to the hotel is not good. It is unpaved roads.",5.0
"One of the better places we stayed in Morocco during our holiday. This boutique hotel has only four rooms and a suite, with a swimming pool, restaurant and exhibition space. The style of the hotel is modern and tastefully minimalistic with a Moroccan touch (except for the interior of the restaurant, which lacks atmosphere and style). The rooms are clean, large, have a rooftop terrace and are located directly at the swimming pool. The restaurant is in another part of the complex, so you don't hear any noise. Food is good as well. Staff very helpful and friendly. Recommended.",5.0

Very calming and cooling for those hot summer months. We were welcomed by a charming young man, Sidi, who was to be our best friend over the next few days. The hotel has only one menu for lunch and dinner and after 3 days became limiting. The chicken pastilla and salad with chevre & dried fruits were outstanding. The medallions of pork must have come from Iberico pigs as the meat was fantastic. They have a nice wine selection that contains some wonderful Spanish vintages.

I didn’t realise how lovely the surrounds were until the morning. I will hope to return in the future with with family and stay for longer and do some hiking and more discovery of the impressive surrounding area. The manager  was very helpful and had some great suggestions of things to do in his beautiful village.  Breakfast was also good.  Wifi not great in the room but ok in reception.

"Auberge Tissadrine was our accommodation for our first night on our three day to the Sahara. Dinner was included and this was a mega tagine that was shared between the group so it wasn't quite enough food. Very late, we ate after 9pm.   Our room was shared for quite a few of us and one of the lights wasn't working. They did swap the bulb but initially resisted and gave me a lecture about how we don't need lights in our life. Odd. The bed was comfy, the blankets plentiful. Basic bathroom setup, make sure you have your own toiletries. Mint tea on arrival is always a good thing.   The location is great. Right next to the gorge and a flow of running river which makes for some ambient noise. Nice and quiet in the evening. Wi-Fi was free but the signal made it largely unusable.…",3.0

The staff (the human factor-Aziz and Rahma ) will make you feel welcome the minute you step in with the traditional mint tea and cookies. Any 5 Star hotel will struggle to beat Dar Rita",5.0
"I stayed two nights in Dar Rita. I was very well received by the friendly staff. The owner gave me very nice tips to discover Ouarzazate region. The room was clean, and the typical breakfast was delicious. The neighborhood is calm, you can feel the Moroccan life around the riad.",5.0
"First off, friendly staff. Aziz played a great host. He was welcoming and talked to us about things to do around Ouarzazate.  Its almost important to have a layover in Ouarzazate when driving to the desert or back to Marrakech. This is a nice refuge where the riad is nice, clean, and well maintained. The morning breakfast was delicious as well!  The main attractions are nearby (driving) and the main town center is within walking distance (10-15 mins)  Riad can be a little hard to find. They have put signs on the main road to help. We asked a couple of locals and they helped us find the hotel. There is parking outside the hotel (we didn't have to pay - since there was no security guard).  Great hotel, great staff - highly recommend. Aziz Abdo is a wonderful host!",5.0
Nothing to complain about this place. Rooms are clean and nice staff helpful and breakfast freshly cooked. Good value for the price in Ouarzazate. It is a bit hard to find but signs indicate clearly the route. The neighborhood is quiet and away from the touristic spots. We appreciated our stay.,3.0
"You need to make a few twists and turns to find it, but Dar Rita is worth the effort. Friendly and welcoming staff, lovely decor and architecture, pretty reliable hot water, and good food make a combination that is hard to beat in this price range.",5.0
"It wasn't hard to find, but the location of Dar Rita is a little out of the way. Tucked within dusty Tassoumaat village -- a very local, working class residential area -- it is about 1.5 km to the centre of Ouarzazate town. The route to the town centre is straightforward (along the main road) and there is a bus service, but the latter may not be as frequent as one would like. It's possible to walk -- since it was a cool November -- taking about 25 minutes, though summer would be a different proposition.  The town centre is about the only part of Ouarzazate where dining options were available, with about 10 restaurants. Otherwise, arrange with Aziz, the manager of Dar Rita, to dine in.  Aziz is super-friendly and helpful. always offering tea and biscuits each time I came back to…",4.0
"An overnight stopover at Ouarzazate on our way to Erfoud at this property was indeed a wonderful experience. Quite close to the city centre, This place is aesthetically done up with artefacts and brilliant colours.  The manager Aziz with his ever smiling face welcomed us and since we were hungry after a long bus ride, whipped up an awesome Moroccan omelette for us ! The other lady staff were also very friendly !   The rooms are small, but very cozy. The common areas are large and have a verity of board games and books to keep you busy !  The roof top is also a good place to relax !   The breakfast spread was sumptuous and also included traditional Moroccan fare, which was a surprise.   The city centre is around 20 minutes walk from the Dar Rita and its a nice place to stroll…",5.0
"This was one of our favorite stays in Morocco. We originally booked only two nights, but after my wife and I became ill during our stay, Aziz the property manager was nice enough to let us book a third night to recover. The service was excellent...top quality. The breakfast was the best we had all trip...many places only offer bread and spreads, but Dar Rita gives you fruit, yogurt, bread, eggs, cereal and more. Perfect for filling you up before a day of exploring the nearby sights! It's a little outside the city center of Ouarzazate, so keep that in mind if you want something walkable...you'll need a taxi or bus to get downtown or other places. We rented a car and there isn't really a dedicated parking lot...we just parked close by and I'm pretty sure our car got scratched…",5.0
"With board games and large common areas Dar Rita is set up to encourage guests to socialise and trade travel stories. Unfortunately, due to our time constraints we couldn't take full advantage of this but we enjoyed relaxing on the roof top (where we could hear goats bleating from the neighbour's roof!). Although we would have liked to walk to dinner all restaurants are driving distance from the neighbourhood we were staying in. We shared a triple room and although it was fine for one night - it was quite a tight squeeze once both ourselves and our bags were inside. That said, both the room, and the bathroom were exquisitely decorated. Breakfast the next day was one of the best of our trip!",4.0
Here you'll live in a typical/ characteristic neighborhood with friendly staff and great level of cleanliness. We recommend! They also serve a very good meal and have a beautiful terrace where you can rest at the end of the day.,4.0
"The review is a bit overdue as we stayed at Dar Rita in March. The hosts were absolutely fantastic - Joao went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable, picking us up when we were quite lost in Ouarzazate. The other staff were extremely friendly, as were the guests. We got some great tips on where to go next in Morocco from Joao.  The place itself is tucked away in a nice local part of town where we had no trouble leaving the car. The rooms were very clean and all done out in a traditional style - we felt at home straight away and had all the amenities we needed. They put on a very nice, hearty traditional Moroccan breakfast.",5.0
"Dar Rita has the most enthusiastic staff we encountered in our travels. Very friendly and always happy to help. Dinner here is a must, the food is fabulous, definitely one of the best meals we had in all of Morocco. Amazing. Rooms are spacious and clean. Only complaint is the location, a bit of a walk from the city centre and a bit hard to find the first time.",4.0
"One of the best hotel in whole Morocco! Happy and very helpful staff and friendly atmosphere. The owner Joao was a great guide and help us a lot! Honestly ask him anything about history of Morocco or local people and he will surprise you with the answer :) Great people, tasty food and lovely apartments. If you are looking for something cozy and stylish and you appreciate a good company, Dar Rita is absolutely a place to be! Once again thank you guys. Shukran and see you very soon!",5.0
"beautiful riad, Rita made my dream come thru by organasing the tour  for 5 days to the Sahara desert our privete driver was very competent and profectional .every one is so polite and kind, the food was amazing  ,,love evrything about rita and this place",5.0
"We had the pleasure of staying 3 nights at the Dar Rita in April. We had a fantastic stay. The first thing that strikes you when you enter is the style and design of this Riad. All the colours, artwork and furniture are beautifully selected and designed. It is almost like staying in a hip art gallery. The other part that we loved were all of the space allotted as common areas. There is space on all 3 levels to hang out and chat with other travellers. With our young boys, they loved having a great satellite TV and games like Monopoly and Jenga. Add the fact that it is super clean and you have a winner.   The staff and location also made this a great stay. Younesse was there all of the time and helped us with directions and booking other hotels. Joao, one of the owners is super…",5.0
"Dar Rita, is all about its people. Joao was immensely nice and welcoming, and the rest of the staff was very nice too. They were both very helpful and attentive. The riad is cosy and clean. But the location wasn't good at ll, it's quite far from the the rest of the city. ",4.0
"What a joy it was to enter this oasis of tranquility on our way to the Sahara!  The welcome was warm and copious, breakfast delicious and abundant and we were sad to have only stayed two nights.  We booked here because we have friends who had stayed here previously and recommended it.  We will do the same!  A big thanks to Joao, Rita and Youssef.  We'll be back soon :-)",5.0
"When passing by Quarzazate, my spirit got renewed with such a warming welcome, excellent food and beautiful taste into what concerns the chosen interior design as well. It was like I have been known Rita and João for a long time, where the warmness made me feel at home, confortable and safe. Peacefulness and relaxing time, colors and friendship were felt in Dar Rita. Highly recommended!!",5.0
"When we travelled to Morocco last month, we were lucky enough to stay at Dar Rita, a very welcoming and beautifully decorated hotel in Ouarzazate, with the perfect location, fabulous decoration, hospitality, ambiance, facilities (wifi free internet, air-conditioning, library, souvenir shop, terrace), etc. Mr. Youssef, the hotel manager, was extremely friendly, showing us all the common areas, guiding us to our room, as well as giving us useful information and advice about this wonderful city and its surroundings. We stayed at the exotic decorated and quite comfortable Room Azamor, but we also had the opportunity of spending quite a few hours on the terrace area, on the third floor, where we could enjoy some sun, while drinking a delicious typical Moroccan tea. And the food...…",5.0
Fantastic cosy hotel with beautiful rooms. Perfect place to stay when visiting Ouarzazate on the way to the desert. The best New Year's ever. Hotel staff are kind and provide great tips. Great experience and highly recommended!,5.0
"We visited Dar Rita on a fabulous trip to Morocco. Rita, the owner of the property, received us very well. We felt as if we were part of that family. We learned a lot about Moroccan culture and the Ouarzazate region. They have a lot of valuable tips for those who like to travel independently in Morocco. The location is great and it was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. The hotel is very pleasant and characteristic. Highly recommended.",5.0
"Three nights at Dar Rita during my Ouarzazate trip was enough to make sure that I am going back soon to this beautiful country and this charming hotel. The atmosphere of the hotel makes you feel home, the staff is really amazing. Without their help I wouldn't have known such a wonderful places that I've been in Morocco desert. More than just a place to stay, Dar Rita is a remarkable place and a great information spot. Be back for sure.",5.0
"I traveled alone and spent a great week at Dar Rita! The hotel is in a good and safe neighborhood. The room was excellent, cozy, quiet and very clean, with a great bed. I was treated very well by the staff who helped me a lot, giving directions and advice whenever I needed. The food was so tasty. And hotel has such a great design, full of such lovely details! Definitely a pleasent experience that I would like to repeat!",5.0
"I got the chance of staying at Dar Rita during the weekend and enjoyed the perfect welcoming hosts. Berber food was very tasty and the rooms were cozy and well decorated. This hotel is located inside a Moroccan residential neighborhood so you get to feel the real Moroccan living. When I got there I was served a fantastic tea with saffron taste and homemade cookies. Breakfast was enough to keep me going for the whole morning. This is the best place to stay and explore Ouarzazate, Fint and Ait Benhaddou.",5.0
"Our family of five (we are from Vancouver, Canada), spent one night in Riad Dar Rita in December 2014. We all had a wonderful time. Short but memorable. The Riad was beautiful, comfortable, and clean. Our hosts were very nice and helpful. Delicious dinner and good breakfast. We highly recommend this riad.",5.0
"Our stay at dar Rita in Ouarzazate was very pleasant. Not only is the Riad itself very cosy, but its staff is super friendly and welcoming. There's a real family feel to it -- from the atmosphere in the Riad to the hearty meals served.",5.0
"exactly ... is the old fountain full of rose petals that calls us to the attention when it comes in that wonderful space, who crosses the old town of narrow streets mazes can not imagine finding a shelter like that in the middle of old walls made of mud . the building seems to have been restored and tastefully decorated , the terrace is very welcoming and will look back is that we realize the contrast. is close to the film studios and one can walk through the old town safely. the owners are the right people to provide information about what to see in Morocco . the food is freshly prepared and very tasty , the rooms and bathrooms are very clean and the wi- fi works well . the price is reasonable",4.0
"This welcoming B&B is Moroccan in all ways (except ownership), but immediately feels like home. The owner, Rita, was an exceptional hostess, providing mint tea on our late arrival and a 4am breakfast on our departure some days later – and other tasty meals in between.  She also talked us through the best excursions based on what we said we wanted to do. She then booked us on a memorable 2 day, 4x4 trip that covered gorges, towns, mountains and sandy desert, with a knowledgeable and friendly guide.  On first approach to Dar Rita, it is slightly off-putting to wander down a lane too narrow for a vehicle, but that ends up being part of the charm of staying in a real Moroccan neighbourhood.  Highly recommended.",5.0
"It was cozy,warm,friendly and in the heart of the old town. The location enabled you to get a glimpse of the ""real"" Morroco. Rita's place was very colourful and looked beautifully Morrocan. Rita was a lovely host,great chef and was extremely friendly. One of our highlights was having a picnic lunch on the rooftop terrace, under the shade of the cabana. We had 4kids aged 10-14 in our group-they relaxed, felt safe running around (even playing soccer with the local kids). Our group enjoyed it as it felt like a home away from home-thanks Rita. Our kids have not stopped talking about when we are going back to Rita's!",5.0
"The reason to stay at Dar Rita is Rita! Our party of seven stayed for only two nights but we were treated like royalty and the food was as divine as many other reviewers have stated.  Be sure to plan a dinner with Rita! it was our best meal in Morocco and we said that everywhere we went until our last night which was with Rita and there was no contest.  Rita arranged two different trips for us which went like clockwork in clean moder vans with a wonderful courteous driver.  Our rooms, the meals and the travel Rita arranged were both our best value and our most enjoyable in two weeks in Morocco.  We cannot recommend Rita and her lovely guesthouse highly enough,",5.0
Probably the most enjoyable meal we had in Morocco during our entire tour was at RIta's Dar. The dar is nicely decorated - a bit unique in some aspects - very comfortable and comparable to many other residences we stayed in Morocco but Rita's home cooked food was uncomparable. Very highly recommended for a great dining experience without compromising the quality of stay.,5.0
"We stayed at Dar Rita for four memorable nights and can not recommend this haven highly enough. The welcome we received on arrival was an indication of things to come - mint tea, cakes and Rita telling the children to treat her house as a home. These comments they took to heart and if asked what they would like to do in the day would answer ""stay at Rita's"". We strongly recommend having dinner there -delicious, delicious, delicious and all  in a very cosy Morrocann style atmosphere. We can not thank Rita enough for all she helped us with during our stay.Rita you gave us the best start to our Morrocan adventure. Merci",5.0
"We arrived to Ouarzazate after a long day and a little concern for our 4x4's tyres. We easily found the cosy square where everybody in the neighbourhood knows Dar Rita, and we were accompanied to the front door and entered this little oasis of kindness. The tea and the pastries we were welcome-served left a mark and made us feeling very good right away. The international flavour of the place and the close connection to the local people that it offers to the travellers looking for the human touch make of it a very good memory for us. Rita also recommended the perfect place for a nice dinner too, and stayed with us until she waved at our departure.",4.0
"Darling Rita runs a small guesthouse off a small side street in Ouarzazate, close to the bus station.   We  spent 2 nights and ate dinner there both nights.  Rita put flavourful food on the table and a friendly atmosphere.  Unfortunately, the pipes froze overnight on our second night, we couldn't have showers before our taxi out of town.  Fluke weather aside, a great place to stay on the way east out of Marakech.",4.0
"I stayed 3 days in this guest house located on a traditional neighboorhod in Ouarzazate city. It was a bit difficult to find but after asking few people we got there easily. Also my husband's phone map was very useful. Dar Rita is a 3 floors house with a very friendly Portuguese host called Rita. She served us tea and presented us to a very well decorated house. I got to have the biggest room of the house and my daughters got a twin room just close to us. Other clients were on the riad but rita had time to talk with us about her experience in this exotic country. During 3 days we visited the unesco Ksar of Ait Benhaddou, Tifoultoute Kasbah, Taourirt Kasbah, Fint Oasis, Film studios and cinema museum. This was a very nice relaxing city after one busy and euphoric week in…",5.0
"i stayed 3 days in dar rita and felt like home. i took the chance to stay for a few days to recharge my batteries after sahara desert and before heading north of morocco to marrakech, etc. this was the perfect place before going to north morocco. this is a true authentic moroccan house, with not many bedrooms. i also could use free wireless internet. breakfast was the best i had in morocco. bedrooms are cozy and just perfect size for a solo traveler. bathroom very clean and with all necessary amenities. rita the host is very friendly and told me about where to go in the city and the region.",5.0
"Although we had some trouble finding the riad, Dar Rita is located close to the city center. It takes only a ten minute walk to the central square.  Rita is very helpful and transmits a relaxing vibe to her customers, which also reflects in the ambient of the dar. The riad is lovely decorated, has large rooms and excellent facilities for the guests. The breakfast prepared by Rita was the best breakfast we had in Morocco.  We were kept awake by a cat from one of the neighbours that was crying for a long time. Rita went out at night to find the cat and solve the 'problem'. We slept in a very good bed and found all necessary facilities in the bathroom. Unfortunately there was sometimes a distinct smell in the bathroom that we could nog get rid off.",5.0
"Dar Rita is a Riad that offered us a quiet, peaceful sanctuary during our hectic round trip through Morocco. It definitely is a calm and beautifull place to restore your energy. Afterwards it's just a shame that we only spent one night in the riad, cause it is a real getaway in Morocco. The lovely owner Rita and her staff were very attentive and made us feel very welcome. Because the Riad only has a few rooms, which are all individually decorated, it felt very exclusive and everyone was incredibly friendly. The breakfast is very good and a lot of variety so take your time to have breakfast! I would highly recommend this jewel!",5.0
"I spent but a single night inDar Rita but Rita, out of her kindness, effectively organized the balance of my holiday and my wife's travels, who was joining me later.  The accommodation was excellent and albeit I only spent a few hours in my room due to a late arrivel and eraly departure the next morning i can vouch for an excellent breakfast.  Thanks Rita",5.0
"Yes, it is small. But we were very charmed by how clean and cosy the place is. Rita, the owners as well as the the 2 ladies who work there are just so nice and polite beyond words. Myself and my husband really felt like home even though we stayed only for 1 night.",5.0
"This is a fantastic place to stay if you want to visit Ouarzazate.Food and accommodation are excellent and Rita is an excellent hostess, very helpful and knowledgeable about the area. We would love to return to Dar Rita someday and have no hesitation recommending it to others.",5.0
"Hard to say enough good things about our stay here! From tea on the terrace, to a local drumming troupe that played during dinner, to dinner itself which was smashing (yes, I would sell my mother for that carrot recipe)... Rita and her staff were perfect as both professional hosts and new friends.  I almost started feeling bad that they were still in the kitchen while we were all having so much fun.",5.0
"Dar Rita is a truly lovely place to stay. Rita, the owner is so very helpful. Food and accommodation are excellent. Well worth a visit. We stayed for a week at the end of March and would have been happy to stay longer. We are very pleased to have found the riad and hope to return.",5.0
"The portuguese Rita (some people think she's flemish but she isn't ) is very zen ;-) maybe a little bit too zen ;-) because I missed some typical berber music in the house, p.e. during breakfast or diner... sometimes it was too quiet,  but for the rest everything was perfect.",4.0
"Our stay at Dar Rita was most welcomed and a desirable stop either if you are going further into the mountain range or coming out of it. Not only the city proves to be an opportunity to gear up and acquire supplies but the stay here also feeds the mind and the heart. Rita is an amazing host and her house features the best she and Ouarzazate have to offer.  I thank her many times for making our stay and moroccan experience so pleasant, our food so tasty and our sleep so peaceful.",5.0
"The most cozy and welcoming home we experienced on our trip across Morocco. Both Rita and Joao make excellent company and not to mention delicious, homemade food. We had been advised on several occasions by local drivers and guides to give Ouarzazate a miss and head on for the next town. But thankfully we stuck to arrangements and promises, which turned out the best of decisions. We were greeted with warm smiles, good tea and splendid desserts (my fav on the trip, thank you Rita!) and shared a great sunset on the roof (thank you Joao!). Well decorated interior boosts the homely relaxing feel, comfortable and quiet rooms enable a good night's rest. You have to visit!",5.0

"Apologies Rita for taking so long to write this review. My family stayed at Dar Rita last April 2011. Rita welcomed us into her beautiful abode and made us immediately feel at home. She and her brother have creatively renovated an old house  which is clean, comfortable and authentically decorated. Her meals were original with a Portuagese touch. We fondly remember the avocado fruit smoothie in the morning. Our 15 year old daughter loved the internet and could email to her heart's content while her mom and dad chatted to Rita until late in the night. We arrived as strangers and parted as friends. We loved the fact that the Riad  was in  a local area and not touristy. Our room overlooked the neighbor's goats! Our daughter complained that her single bed was a bit hard and narrow…",5.0

The food, Moroccan, with Rita's ""finger"" is amazing. I totally recommend you to stay in the Riad, if you're going to Morocco!",5.0
"Rita, a young portuguese women, has spent 2 years renovating a house in an ""authentic"" neighbourhood and has opened this lovely riad about half a year ago. It is evident that Rita supervised is all, did it hands on and lovingly collected all decorative items one by one to create a special and warm home to which she welcomes her guests.  She and her cook prepare all the marvelous food (vegetarian) based on genuine moroccan dishes, neighbour's receipes and of course Rita's ingenuity. The rooms are beautiful and special. Rita - thanks for your hospitality and a wonderful experience !",5.0
"We highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the South of Morocco. The Riad is surrounded by a great neighborhood.  Dar Rita has a typical atmosphere and a nice rooftop terrace, that makes you feel deeply inside of traditional feeling of Ouarzazate. The owner, Rita, is very friendly and extremely helpful, as she is always giving  tips to improve our tour.  The typical food is excellent even if you are vegetarian like us. Staying for more than one night at Dar Rita is like being at home.  *****  5 STARS",5.0
"Rita is a Portuguese woman that moved to ouarzazate and open this space. The decoration is beautiful and everything is well taken care of. Rita cooks very well and her food is stunning. There is a lovely terrace in the top and the hotel is the only one in this specific neighbor, which feels very authentic (from the outside, you couldn't say it was an hotel) but it's also very close to the main avenue so the location is great! Fast Wifi.",5.0
"The owner of Dar Rita (her name is Rita) is a perfect hostess that not only makes you feel at home but also provides you with extremely good advices about the places to visit in and around Ouarzazate. Rita can also get you into interesting and nicely priced tours to other places in Morocco, particularly to the desert. The fact that her brother, João Leitão has a vast experience as a guide in Morocco works as a quality certificate that you will have the experience that you are looking for and even more. Dar Rita is a very clean, beautiful, comfortable, cozy and relaxed place where you can rest, relax and plan your tours in Morocco. That is a place where I will return for sure.

"We came to the Dar Rita after we had been to the desert and the gorges. We were exhausted, tired and hoping for a nice place to rest after bad 'hotel'-experiences in the Dades-valley. Dar Rita was the perfect place for all of that. Rita is a perfect host and you can tell that she loves her Riad and being a host. The rooms are quite small (like almost all rooms in Riads) but very nicely and esthetically furnished, you enter the room and feel welcome and at home and immediatly start to relax. Everything is very clean and taken care of.

The room was very cosy, I slept like a baby.  But besides great talks with Rita and João, the top best was the food! The breakfasts where amazing the dinners where outstanding.  I totally recommend you to stay in the Riad if you're going to spend a night in Ouarzazate!",5.0
"After a week traveling in Morocco, the night spent at Dar Rita was an oasis in the middle  of the (lovely) Moroccan  confusion. The owners Rita, João and Nora received us as if we were old friends, making as feel as comfortable as we possible could.  The food, both at dinner and breakfast, was great, with delicious variations of the usual Tajines and couscous.  The bedroom was really clean and comfortable, we had to chance of looking at the remaining rooms and they all have a lovely moroccan decoration. We only felt sorry of not having time to visit Ouarzazate and spend an extra night in Dar Rita. We hope to come back",5.0
"We stayed at Dar Rita as we traveled through Morocco and we love the place and Rita and her Brother Joao and his wife Nora. the place very relaxing, with a great vibe and a fun rooftop terrace to see the sun set over the Altlas mountain.  Rita and Joao were extremely helpful in setting up a desert excursion for us prior to our arrival and also more stuff while we were there, just giving us great information on things to do in the area.  Also, Rita is an amazing cook and we had two fantastic dinners there of some great and authentic Moroccan food, better than the tangine and couscous we were eating everywhere else.  If you are looking for a place that feels like you are staying with good friends, then Dar Rita is that place.",5.0

This Riad is in an offbeat location (in a village) - a great experience living in this area as it is unusual. We loved the clay building type setting and the owner was very welcoming and treated us well. There is no restaurant within walking distance but the Riad prepares lunch/dinner as well and we tried it out - quite nice. Since they weren't too busy (as we went offseason in the middle of the week) we were even upgraded to a better room to feel more comfortable with a separate bed for our daughter. I would definitely recommend this Riad to anyone visiting the Ourzazate area....live in the town in the larger cities like Fez/Marrakesh but in this area live in a Riad like this for a true countryside experience.,5.0
"I stayed here with 2 of my friends and stuff  was very  friendly offer  us tea for welcome   .our room it was clean,  good breakfast , beautiful  terrace where can set and watch stars I do highly  recommend  it . we will comeback  as soon as we can . thanks  again ",5.0
"We booked and prepaid for one night in this Riad on Orbitz months before our trip. When we arrived, the staff had no record of our reservation, and acted very confused even after I showed him the confirmation number (It was a confirmation number that came from the Riad! themselves).  I was put on the phone with the owner by a staff member. He kept asking me where I booked the room. He had never heard of Orbitz. Seems strange, since Orbitz is huge. We were eventually given a room key and put all our stuff inside. I thought all was good and we left to go eat dinner somewhere...  When we came back the owner was waiting for us on the phone again (the staff must have called him when they saw us pull up?). This time, he told us that we had to either leave or pay for the room (a 2nd time) since he couldn’t find our booking and couldn’t honor it (then why did they give us a food key and make us fill out all the paperwork?). At this point, we were so fed up with the unprofessionalism that we left. 8pm and nowhere to stay.  Fortunately, Orbitz gave us our money back and booked us a much nicer hotel outside of town.…",1.0
"A beautiful riad near to Ouarzazate with very friendly people. We were invited to learn how to cook tajine which was lovely! An amazing breakfast is included and the shower was great. By car it was easy to visit places nearby such as the Fint Oasis, Aït Ben Haddou and of course Ouarzazate. Would definitely stay again. Thanks for everything :)",5.0
A cool place just out of the town Ouarzazat. In the evening I took a stroll in the palm groove and field nearby. Very friendly area. Great breakfast provided by a good chef on premises. Also had a fun cooking class one evening so now I know some secrets of the tagine!,5.0

I recommend Sarayas guest house to all travelers who want their stay be memorable nd a unique experience.this excellent location will be the second reason to  come back.

Food is delicious, Rooms are clean, Location is great.  The people were very  Kind and Mohamed he treated us well.  I recommend highly this place",5.0
The riad is absolutely beautiful and so relaxing. Mohammad is a perfect host and went over and above his requirements. We went during Ramadan which was very quiet but it meant we had the place to ourselves! Would definitely come back and definitely recommend a visit. Great value for money.,5.0
"Everything was great at Sarayas GuestHouse, starting with the nice people who welcomed us and always helped with great tips to go around the Ouarzazate region.

"The guesthouse is located in a village with a river and palmerie close to a nice kasbah and a bridge. The interior is clean, cozy, very well designed in traditional style and there are all the necessary amenities (wifi, hot water, a/c, birds). The owner Mohamed is really hospitable and useful. He took me to a nearby places (Ouarzazate, other kasbah) with his vintage car and even helped to organize a visit to a faraway desert (merzouga).

"The riad is very beautiful and extremely relaxing. My friends and I are in our twenties and travelled to Morocco for the first time. it has undoubtedly been one of the best holidays we have had. Mohammed is very welcoming, and even though we visited during ramadan he still made a huge effort to ensure we were comfortable and welcomed, and enjoyed every day of our 8 night stay in the home. Breakfast each morning was tasty and flexible with the timing. We were also privy to some tasty treats in the evening as it was Ifta (the breaking of the fast during ramadan) which we were very greatful for.  Ouarzazate is fairly isolated, but for us, this was exactly what we were looking for. The area is peaceful, hot, and the star-gazing in the evening is perfect! The locals were welcoming…",5.0
"Sarayas Guest House was a very welcomed stop, where I could relax after having trekked Mt Toubkal in Imlil. Prior to my arrival by bus from Marrakech, Mohamed had offered to pick me up from the bus stop in town. Communication was excellent, and he was there waiting for me, when the bus arrived. En route to the hotel we stopped on my request to watch a football game on TV at my request. This was just the first example demonstrating, how he at all times was going out of his way to make me feel at home. Once at the guest house I was given a nice and comfortable room with hot water and a good internet connection. The decoration in Sarayas is traditional, but bright and with a modern touch. Personally, I really liked it ! Sleep quality was great, perhaps with the odd donkey or dog…",5.0
"We enjoyed our brief stay in Ouarzazate with Mohamed and family at Sarayas. He is a very nice and accommodating man, and his son is a sweet little boy. Breakfast in the morning was very nice. Keep in mind that this hotel is in the 12th Century area of town, and so it's not right in the urban center of Ouarzazate. The drive into town isn't too long. You will enjoy the charm of the place and the children playing outside, and the more local flavor of this part of town.",4.0
"I live in Morocco and I have a lot of friends and family coming to see me and visit Morocco. I used to bring them in the south to Ouarzazate and the desert, and the Sarayas is a must stopping place. So I stayed a few times and it's always a real pleasure to meet with Mohamed and his people. We really feel like at home and everyone is ready to help. And Mohamed prepare the best tea in Morocco!",5.0
"Arriving in Morocco can seem a little daunting to begin, but being greeted by such a warm welcome in such a beautiful location couldnt have started my trip any better!

Having now travelled around most of Morocco I can safely say this is my MOST FAVOURITE place to stay",5.0

After a long journey it was wonderful to sit down on a comfortable couch and have some local mint tea and listen to moroccan music in this nice athmosphere. Friendly staff wished me welcome and showed me these clean and comfortable rooms, spacious dining room and the beautiful scenery from to rooftop terrace. This is a perfect base camp to return to after many kinds of activities that they offer you and places you can visit not too far away.",5.0

Mohamed is an excellent host, speaks fluent English and takes great delight in explaining local customs and traditions surrounding his beautiful Guest House.

"To stay at Sarayas Guest house was a one of a kind very special experience. It lays hidden in an old village close to Aouarzazate, from the outside it looks like one of the houses, but as soon as you enter the big door, you find yourself in an oase of Moroccan beauty. Candy for the eyes and instant good vibes. The host, Mohammed, makes this place even more special. With his kind eyes, nice personallity and a lot of energy he took care of us very well. We had Moroccan tea, and the Tajine he made us was so tasty.. I will never forget it.  The whole experience was magical and like being in a dream. The next morning when we left I felt extremely happy and I was aware of the fact that my stay in Sarayas Guest House was one of the nicest nights in my life. I strongly recommend anyone…",5.0

"We called in at Sarayas Guest House for lunch on our way through the Atlas Mountains.  Mohammed gave us the most wonderful lunch - fresh, tasty and fabulous -  and made us all really welcome.

All the rooms are en suite and delightfully decorated in typical Moroccan style.  Would not hesitate to recommend this riad, and hope to make our way back some day soon inchalla.",5.0
"Visited Sarayas Guest House / Riad Sarayas for the first time in October this year.  Mohamed was an excellent host and made us all feel at home.  The decor is traditional, beautiful and it is obvious a lot of hard work and thought has gone into ensuring there is a Moroccan feel to the place.  All the rooms are also nicely decorated and have their own private bathrooms.  The food was also out of this world.  Thank you Mohamed and hope to see you again next year.",5.0
"We spent two nights in Mohamed's guest house. He was charming host who tried to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Guest house is located 15 minutes drive out of Ouarzazate.

Price for Moroccan standards on the high side (€ 30 per person per night incl breakfast and dinner = € 60 per room per night for 2 people, after negotiation finally payed € 70 for 2 rooms / 4 people incl breakfast and dinner) The road from the village to the tented camp (+/- 1 km) is pretty bad, but managable for a normal car.",4.0
"The room had a dirty floor. The Wi-Fi did not work. The shower head kept falling down. The staff in the restaurant was rude and told us we could not bring in our own bottled water. The room was at the far end of the hall and the light outside the door was broken, so the hall was pitch black. The light switches in the hall are three feet above the floor and the lights are on timers, so if you don’t walk fast enough they cut off before you get to your room. The room faces the street and a dog barked all night.",3.0
"This is a glamorized roadside motel and nothing more. We had to stay in this hotel as part of our Morrocco package chartered by Exoticca. I was horrified by entering the room and seeing the bathroom, old and threadbare towels, and toilet status that someone before us did not flush. God knows if there was ever housekeeping in that room.  YES, the outdoor pool and area look glamorous but that's the only thing this hotel can offer. We had multiple people from our tour spending most of their night by the pool so they don't have to go into their rooms. I have never had such a bad experience in any hotel. Not recommended at all.",1.0
My son and his wife are staying there right now and I'm horrified to read the past reviews about being robbed by staff! This has happened to them atm!

As it was winter, we did not try the pools as they were very cold but they looked satisfactory. My only problem was that when having a shower, the entire bathroom got soaked which I discovered after leaving my change of clothes out and was quite angry! As long as you are aware of this, you shouldn’t encounter any issues. Would recommend!",4.0
"We had the pleasure of a one night stay over in this lovely Hotel. It was very clean, quiet and in a great location to see some of the local sights. Our room was a good size for us and had access to an outdoor area where we could take in some great views of the surrounding landscapes. There is a supermarket across the road and ATM machine very nearby. During our stay we came across a large local market in the Place Al-Mouahidine. We had a great time wondering around looking at all the stalls and families just enjoying a night out. ",4.0

"My second time in Ouarzazate though my first staying at the Perle Du Sud, we stayed for two nights. Firstly, the positives. The location was decent enough. 10 minutes walking to the square. Parking is free just outside across the street from the hotel. The staff were friendly enough.  And the negatives. Overall, the hotel is pretty tired, and has seen better days. Better management and organisation could make this decent, but its lacking sadly.  We moved room after the first night. We had room 307 and the aircon was many years beyond being effective. It was badly located and had little effect. It was pushing 40 degrees in the middle of the day at the time. The room wasn’t somewhere you’d want to be at any time really. It was an incredibly hot night and there were a lot of flies in the room. It wasn’t pleasant  The bathroom was fine (for North Africa) but the shower sprayed erratically and so drenched the bathroom regardless of how you used it. It just needs a descale, clean or a new head. Simple and cheap stuff really. There was no window in the bathroom and the extractor fan had long since stopped working judging by the exposed cables. Staying just in this room would be a 1 star or lower review.  So, I asked about the aircon, I didn’t think it would be fixed or a move of room would be different. So I asked if we could just have a small desk fan or similar for the room. This wasn’t possible, no fans in the entire hotel. So we moved rooms to room 304 for night 2. It was a lot better in all respects, still not great, the air con weak, but at least better positioned and the room was better ventilated. The toilet was next to the shower cubicle (you’d put your legs around the cubicles wall). But it was still better. This room is maybe a 2-3 star room (given the price).  Other factors to talk about. The staff were all friendly enough but not all very useful. A young lady with a pierced lip was very good and dealt with the issues with the aircon after other colleagues had promised and failed to fix it, get a fan, move us.  Breakfast is ok, for 4 euros you can eat well enough and I good enough value. When we were there they were undertaken some construction in the dining area, and half was curtained off from the seating area (but not drinking area). So during breakfast time, the workmen were banging and smashing the floor up with hammers. Food good enough, ambience lacking.  Swimming pool & bar. We booked this hotel (not the one I previously stayed at which was excellent) partly for the swimming pool and bar. Both do indeed exist. The bar was never open though, maybe they’d have opened it, but wanting just a single beer, i’m not going to ask. The ‘Nightclub’ below was padlocked, so that’s good or bad depending what you want. The swimming pool looks nice, but the water does not. It was littered with leaves and looked dirty. We gave it a miss.  The bar and pool swayed us to stay and so this disappointed. I cant really recommend it, there Is much better in town. Hopefully the will improve the management of it and it may come good, but this wasn’t so when we stayed…",1.0
"Nice hotel, great location few minutes walk to city center. the breakfast is good with great selections. the styling is a bet old but looks very nice, room is clean and decent size. the stuff and owner are  very helpful.",5.0

"We stayed just for one night, but were quite satisfied. Breakfast was good, with variety of products, location is nice, near the city centre, our second floor room was quiet (we did not hear any noise from the disco located inside the hotel - maybe it was closed on a February Friday). Ample parking space at the street in front of the hotel's entrance. Pleasant and kind staff. All in all, not bad for an economic stay.",4.0

"I'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere that feels authentically Moroccan.  It's a no frills hotel but the rooms are very comfortable, bathrooms large, and the details more than make up for the fairly basic facilities.  The décor in the lounge is very intricate and the pool area is a great place to spend a few hours. There's a fairly limited but good selection of food at breakfast and the staff are very friendly and keen to please.",3.0

Of course I got a good room and then changed to an even better one. I was sad to leave the hotel after my stay and the staff there told me that they will miss me. I separate the rating in different categories. Location: it is located very well, near to everything, to the market, shops, bus Rooms: I had a very nice room, spacious, with own balcony and nice.

The rooms and bathrooms are clean and the staff is very friendly.   The breakfast is delicious with traditional moroccan food as well as western breakfast.   The hotel has an amazing pool area to relax and/or swim in summer.  I would definitively recommend this hotel to anyone staying or passing by Ourzazate as a comfortable and affordable stay.",5.0

"This is a very unhygienic, noisy and confused hotel. It all started with them not being able to find our reservation. So it seemed like we were just put in a random room. Then we checked out the pool, which we were promised. It smelled and the pidgeons used it for bathing and drinking. It's sides are full of brown mold and feathers... we didn't see anyone take a swim which we fully understand!  Instead we wanted to get a good nights sleep in order to be well rested for our road trip - in the hotel booking it says that we would be in a sound isolated room - only there were a big hole under the door.Around midnight the night club opened and ""entertained "" us with loud base rytms for more than three hours.

"We only stayed one night, the place was very cheap, and the place just really served the purpose of a place to crash before we continued on our road trip the next day, so although the hotel was far from five star it served its need.   A few minor things were dealt with quickly (one of the locks on the door of one of our rooms didn't work, the music by the pool was too loud, etc.), but the staff were very obliging and friendly.

The toilet in our room didn't flush, but the staff at the reception were very helpful and quick to offer us another room. The bathroom in our new room was large, as was the bed. The in-room fridge was very much appreciated, and the view from the balcony was brilliant: an east-facing view of the desert - and of our car.  The pool was very refreshing and had a gym and bar next to it.   Other reviews have suggested it has faded glamour and could do with renovations. This may be true, but the hotel is still very clean and an absolute bargain for the price.",4.0

Stayed one night with a friend. The hotel needs major renovation . It has lost its charm. If work was done it could be much better.   Helpful staff but without that warm welcome I'm used to get in Morocco.   On the plus side: Location on the main street Elevator  Beer (2 euros each) Cheap choice (40 euros double) Pool  On the minus side: Broken air conditioning on our room. Shower curtain does not reach the floor. You flood all the bathroom as you shower .  Pool with plastic borders dirty and broken . Average breakfast .,3.0
"Reviewing this hotel is hard, it was a part of an all inclusive tour and we got a really good price on the tour.  This was the last hotel on our tour and we came straight from having spent the night in a tented camp in the desert. I sooo longed for a shower. That did not happen as there was just ice cold water in the shower. The next moring, the hot water was back.  The rooms and common areas are very dated and in strong need of an upgrade.  As far as service goes they tried their best, but when we asked for a map of the city when going out they didn't have one. All hotels should be able to offer guest a map.  Location vice it's somewhat of a walk to get to the nicer parts of town with good hotels, but it's close to the shopping street.  I still choose to rate it a three as it…",3.0
"To start with, the rooms here are not too bad for the price.  A clean room and a comfortable bed should have made for a good nights' sleep.  However, this hotel apparantly rents rooms en masse to young teenagers who think nothing of partying all night long.  I did not sleep more than 1/2 hour at a stretch because of people playing loud music, yelling, stomping, screaming, and pounding on doors.  This was not just in the nearby rooms, but also in the hallway, in the stairs and in the lobby lounge area.  The loud noise continued all night even until 6am.  In the morning, I walked downstairs for breakfast and was greeted by a smoky and messy lobby filled with a dozen kids still having their good time.

"We stayed here on our way to the desert for a school trip I ran. The hotel is very large and was a nice place to stay. We had good size rooms but these were much more 'universally' themed than we had experienced in Marrakech. The rooms were clean but showers dos struggle for hot water. The pool was super cold, although it was refreshing after a day in the sun.  The breakfast was basic as expected but still a good enough selection.  Overall a good stop off, would probably not stay here for a week but that's ok for me.",3.0
"We booked a cheap hotel as a stop over to Marrakesh.   To start with the negatives: * Ouarzazate suffers from regular power outages (meaning no electricity for hours in the entire city), while the hotel only has a generator for the lobby. My wife had fallen ill which made the stay in a pitch black room / hotel a bit odd. * the smell of sewage is not great at the front of the hotel. * We booked and got a standard room at the front of the hotel (same smell). Unfortunately our bath was blocked so we could not take a shower. * Rooms at the front of the hotel are above a night club. * Dinner quality is average (it is what you pay for)  Positives: * After complaining about our room and the smell we got a bigger room at the back of the hotel.

La Perle Du Sud met our expectations, however low they were, so I don't have too much to complain about.

"Me and my boyfriend were in this accommodation last April and we were very happy to be there. It's a great environment, next to the ""relatively"" big city of Ouarzazate there is this hidden tents in the oasis, right next (not to say in the middle of) the plantations. Keep in mind that it's not a reasonable waking distance from Ouarzazate city center, we had a car and it's maybe 5min driving distance. Everything was very clean and the hosts were super welcoming. I'm not sure if we liked better the mornings, waking up in such a place is just great; the evening with the sunsets in the middle of the palm trees; or the nights, when we understood the reason for the bivouac name! A very charming place indeed!",5.0
"I am extremely grateful to my hosts Hassan,Hussein, M'Barack and M'Barack's wife Soumeya for their amazing kindness and generosity.  As soon as I arrived, tired after a long trip, I was pampered like a princess!  Despite the late hour I could upon arrival: -eat a delicious homemade couscous  -enjoy the already warm hammam and a delightful scrub given by Soumeya  Hassan and Hussein also helped me a lot for many small practical details of my trip  The tent was spacious, clean and comfortable. I loved the surroundings of palm trees, vegetable patches, frogs, birds and other lovely animals.  I highly recommend this place and its friendly owners. I'll be back there anytime I stop in Ouarzazate.",5.0

One of the family members guided us on a full day hike over the mountain and through tiny villages where we got to see daily life. We were even welcomed into a villager's home for lunch! This day was a highlight of our 2 week trip through Morocco.  Breakfasts and dinners here were delicious and cooked with the freshest ingredients. In the morning, we got to watch the women bake bread.  This is a great place to stay to get a glimpse into life in this corner of the world. ",5.0

"Our trip to this Gite was an unexpected surprise, visually, emotionally and for our tastebuds.  One moment we were staring at high mountains, and another moment we were on top of those mountains and looking down. As you walk down the narrow valleys, and rocky paths, many children come running to you, merely to interact with you— it’s adorable. On our way up to the mountains, goat herds walk alongside with us. On a warm day, the streams may be dried up and on the cooler days the water from the rain / mountains streams through the rocks.   The food was purely organic. They don’t believe in freezers :).   Bassou, one of the gentleman working there to me embodied the soul of that place. Bursting with life, relentlessly eager to serve and to make you happy. Husain, the owner was so kind and funny. And Souffiya hosted us at her place for tea and even took me for prayers at the mosque.   May God bless these people. What an honor to have been there.…",5.0
"We stayed here for 2 nights.  Wow what an experience.  First I must state that if your idea of a good vacation is a 5 star hotel with king size beds, and luxury, this is not for you.  If you are looking for an experience of a lifetime, this is the place for you.  First of all you are in the middle of nowhere, with the Atlas mountains surrounding you.  This is how the Berbers live everyday, both the males and the females of the household wake up early and work all day until the sun goes down.  We had 2 dinners there, one of which we helped prepare.  They showed us how to make couscous, tangine and donuts from scratch.  The owner of the gite was very friendly and couldn't do enough for us.  We were treated with respect and felt as if we were part of their family.  A calf was born the day before we arrived, and one of the children took the time to take us to the calf so we could see it first hand.  We also took the walking tour of the town which was both breathtaking and educational.…",4.0
"Staying with the Azabi family is always a pleasure. I've been coming here for three years now, and it is my favourite place to stay in the Atlas Mountains. The hotel is built as an authentic Adobe building, and with its atria, balconies, terrace and dining space it exudes the personality and character of the hosts. The Valley of the Roses is beautiful, and a quaint alternative to the busier touristic Dades Valley. I enjoy meeting travellers on their way through the Atlas, coming from all sorts of places. Rooms are always clean, and the food is generous and good.",5.0
"We recently spent two nights at the Gite on a Peregrine Adventures tour; it was quite possibly the favourite part of an amazing adventure.  The reviews on the Gite summarize the ins and outs of this hotel.  It is truly an amazing place to experience the warmth and lifestyles of rural Morocco and its people.  The staff and family who own the Gite are warm, welcoming and have great senses of humour. The food was plenty and tasty and the rooms were cozy. It is true this is not a 5 or 4 star resort, but it is the uniqueness of what the owner family have to offer that makes this place so special.  So, if you are planning to go here, abandon your western expectations, get ready to immerse yourself in rural Moroccan lifestyle and make efforts to get to know this lovely family - they will make it worth your while!   Thank you Husain, staff and family - we will always remember our time with you with so much fondness.  Of additional note - we found while in Morocco that children often approached us asking for candy or pens.  We took pens to the gite intending to give them to the children in the village, but they suggested, and agreed, to take them to the local school for us. If you do like to give to the country you visit - this could be a good option for you.  Balls as well as school supplies, would also be needed for the children.…",5.0
"We stayed here 2 nights as part of an Intrepid group and it proved to the hilight of the trip  for most of our group.   It is reached by a scenic winding road that runs up a pretty gorge about 30 min from the nearest large town. The road is best driven in daylight.   The location is splendid, perched on the side of a steep red gorge overlooking the confluence of 2 rivers. The baren red rocks gave way to a brilliant green ribbon of cultivated land flanking the river below which made for great photographs.

The meals were freshly prepared, delicious, and served either on the terrace which featured a truly amazing view or in the nicely decorated indoor dining hall. The owners and staff are all wonderfully welcoming and very kind.  This is one of the best places I've ever stayed my entire life, and I will always remember it.

The owner is very welcoming and the staff really eager to please. We were able to see how they made fresh bread, goat cheese and cooking Moroccan fare.

The resturant was an enormous area that allowed for staying groups to keep to themselves or to mingle. Dinner was amazing but that was nothing compared to breakfast doughnuts.. yes breakfast doughnuts!! They were AMAZING!.  We had THE best lunch after the walk to the kasbah.

Spent extra time with Matt/Mohamed and THAT was another level of insight to music and it's connection to the area and to history.  Internet is available, but spotty.

Very friendly and loving people. The family showed us their traditional way to cook bread and how they make their butter (traditional way).

A maze to get around.  WiFi is only available in the dining area, across from the hotel, and if more than two people are using it,becomes very slow.  If you get lost in the maze trying to find your way, that family just looks at you like you are stupid and doesn’t offer to help.  ",2.0

Lighting too dim to read easily at night, a bedroom door which didn’t close properly, wifi very patchy and not available at all in rooms, a treacherous shower which also left water all over the floor.

We visited as part of a tour group and were welcomed into the family home for tea, shown around their animal compound and through all the kitchen facilities, and invited back to watch the hotel bread supply being made next morning.    When you look around and see the harsh conditions this hotel operates in, you get a renewed appreciation for what is on offer.  Recommended as a truly local experience.

But the quality of the food, the truly beautiful and remote setting and genuine friendliness of this large Berber family more than compensated for the drawbacks first experienced.

Being winter, there were several layers of blankets on the bed. I found this quite heavy and felt like I was sleeping in a bear hug on the first night. I slept much better on the second night, after peeling back a couple of layers. Whilst the bathroom was compact and basic, it had great water pressure and I enjoyed lovely hot showers.

What a wonderful feast for breakfast: bread straight out of the wood-fired oven, home made fig jam and more - a great way to start the day. Dinners were wonderful  too.

Rooms are nice, food is great and the whole family is friendly and welcoming. A very nice experience. ",5.0
"We spent 5 nights at the Ecofarme. It has been absolutely wonderful. It is an actual farm (permaculture style) and the brothers running it work in the fields with a team to have the best possible products for their guests.   The rooms are comfortable with nice private toilets and showers.   The food that Mohammed and his brother Hissan, together with the cousin Suhad cooked everyday for us has been the best in all Morocco. Picking fresh vegetable from their own gardens, they made the most amazing dishes.   We went there with public transport and Mohammed helped us getting around aboard his amazing 1975 Renault 12. This in itself is already worth the visit.   We are so happy we went there and recommend it to anyone wanting an authentic, simple but incredible experience.",5.0
"Le site est exceptionnel. Situé dans la palmeraie de skoura, c'est un véritable havre de paix. Les gîtes sont spacieux, bien décorés et au calme. Le reste du site est magnifique et bien pensé, encore mieux que sur les photos. Les différents espaces extérieurs sont spacieux et cela permet des espaces au choix. Mohammed et Hicham sont des passionnés. Ils sont dans le partage et la convivialité, tout en restant discrets. Les discussions ont été passionnantes. Ils nous ont vraiment gâtés. La cuisine est excellente, typique avec des produits locaux et bio. Le prix est très abordable. Nous avons sillonnés la palmeraie avec Mohammed qui nous a guidé, expliqué plein de choses et qui nous a mené vers une kasbah abandonnée. Nous avons décidé de cette excursion au dernier moment et il a été très disponible. Nous avons passé un super séjour chez eux, bien trop court. Nous conseillons de s'immerger labas bien 2 ou 3 nuits sans hésitation. Nous garderons un souvenir exceptionnel de ce passage et nous y reviendrons à coup sûr sur un prochain passage.…",5.0
Endroit magique en toute simplicité au cœur de la palmeraie ! Les frères ont repris la maison familiale pour en faire un vrai acte de paix pour les visiteurs. Nous avons déjeuné sur l’agréable terrasse. L’accueil est incroyable! Nous n’avons pas dormi mais avons vu une des chambres ( familiale ). On rêve de revenir avec nos enfants!,5.0
"Nous avons passé une nuit à l'éco ferme, le cadre est idyllique au milieu de la palmeraie, le silence y reigne ! Mohammed nous a fait un repas digne d'un grand chef, il s'est mit en 4 pour nous faire plaisir ! Je recommande vivement cet endroit !",5.0
"Sans exagération aucune, mon séjour à la ferme a été mon meilleur séjour dans un établissement au Maroc,  si ce n'est au monde entier, et ceci grâce à l'hospitalité  et la gentillesse de Mohamed et Hicham, les deux frères fondateurs et dirigeants du projet, qui n'ont d'égales que la beauté de la nature de la région.  L'endroit est un vrai havre de paix en plein milieu de la palmeraie historique de Skoura. Le calme règne sur l'endroit, vous n'entendrez que les chants des oiseaux et autres sons de la nature. Même en étant en plein milieu de la nature, les chambres sont cosy et comfortables,  pourvues de tout le nécessaire et surtout parfaitement propres. Les activités et excursions organisées par Mohamed sont très instructives et agréables. Vous pourrez par exemple, à travers une balade dans la palmeraie, apprendre l'histoire de Skoura et de la région tout en vous rafraichissant à l'ombre des jardins d'arbres fruitiers et fleuris. En rendant visite à une famille de potiers, vous vous essayerez à l'art ancestral de la poterie typique de la région, encore pratiquée avec de simples outils manuels (mention spéciale pour Mohamed le potier pour sa bonne humeur communicative et sa patience). Il peut également vous proposer des circuits adaptés à vos préférences.  La cuisine de Hicham est variée et surtout tellement délicieuse (c'est un chef professionnel diplômé en cuisine), ma mère atteste que son couscous est le meilleur qu'elle ait jamais mangé,  et pourtant c'est une dame marocaine d'un certain âge! Nous avons été touchées par les innombrables attentions et gentillesses de Mohamed et Hicham. Ils sont réellement passionnés et investis dans leur projet, et ne lésinent sur aucun effort pour que leurs convives soient contents. Vous aurez l'impression de rendre visite à la famille plutôt que d'être dans un établissement hôtelier, tellement leur accueil est sincère et chaleureux. Ils ont su préserver l'authenticité et l'hospitalité marocaines, et faire perdurer les traditions locales tout en respectant l'environnement. Il est donc important d'encourager un tel projet plutôt que d'autres qui tombent malheureusement dans le piège du tourisme de masse.…",5.0
"Qu'est-ce qu'on aimerait retourner chez Mohamed en cette période tellement etrange de confinement.....  Mohamed nous a accueilli de manière exceptionnelle ne sachant plus ce qu'il aurait pu faire pour s'occuper mieux de nous: visites, repas, chambre, lieux tout était juste parfait!  On reviendra c'est sur!  Le calme, le cadre, la beauté de ce lieu.... Tout est parfait; ideal en famille mais aussi pour des retrouvailles entres amis ou en famille!  À bientôt Mohamed!!!!",5.0
"En promenade dans la palmeraie, nous sommes arrivés par hasard dans cette éco-ferme. Accueillis gentiment par Mohamed, nous avons eu l'occasion de visiter l'intérieur de la propriété: des bungalows joliment décorés, des arbres fruitiers, des animaux, etc. Mohamed et son frère nous ont réservé un accueil très chaleureux. Nous avons discuté de plein de choses autour d'un bon thé au thym et qq biscuits typiques. Faites le détour, osez passer la porte, c'est un véritable coin de paradis tenus par deux frères qui ne cherchent qu'à faire plaisir !",5.0
Stayed here for 4 nights with my sister and our children we loved everything. Mohamed and his brother as well as the wamen in the kitchen were all so nice and helpful.the ecolodge consists a big garden with beautiful sitings where you can read under the palmes .our kids loved the animals and enjoyed feedind them all the time. I recommande 100% this lodge for all families traveling with kids who are looking for a hiden paradise To relaxe in the oasis of skoura.,5.0
"Kasbah is located right in the middle of the oasis and has a lot of atmosphere and great tajines. Especially the rooftop terrace is nice. Mohammad and Fatima are great host, speak good English and make sure you enjoy your stay, e.g. Mohammed drew a map for us to explore the Palmeira on foot by ourselves",5.0
"A great find in Skoura, we stayed here for a week, and then returned on our way back to Marrakesh.  Mohammed (the owner) an his family did everything they could to ensure we had a good holiday, their cooking was excellent with a variety of tagines and other dishes. Mohammed was happy to show us around the oasis, as well as giving suggestions for places outside the oasis.  Rooms at the hotel were comfortable with air conditioning and free WiFi.  Would happily return to the hotel.",5.0

"Dar Dmana was a real find for us as we arrived in the dark to Skoura and having decided the first place we tried wasn't quite up to scratch, we were recommended to have a look at Dar Dmana. Mohammed and his family welcomed us into the beautifully appointed courtyard and we couldn't resist the opportunity to stay in their delightfully decorated traditional rooms.  Mohammed couldn't have done more for us, lighting a fire so we could have a hot shower and finding us dinner even though it was late. We were welcomed onto the top terrace with traditional mint tea to accompany the glorious blood red sunset across the palmerie. The food was excellent and the dining room is truly stunning. In fact, the whole place is packed with beautiful terraces and nooks to sit in and would be a wonderful place to have a big group in.…",5.0
"Dar Dmana is an absolutely gorgeous hotel in Skoura, one of the biggest oases in Morocco. We were welcomed with tea on the roof terras and the owner explained us one of the hiking trails to the top of the hill and recommended us to go to the local kasbah. We did both activities and they were a lot of fun. We had dinner there that night which was delicious and home-cooked, and after that we played guitar with the owners kid and we could borrow their drums etc. The rooms are absolutely gorgeous as well and the shower had hot water, which was a first on our trip through Morocco!",5.0
"Dar Dmana is a beautiful kasbah in Skoura, the rooms are clean and nicely decorated, the terrace provides a great view on the mountains and the Palmerie. Mohammed and his wife Fatima make the most to make you feel at home. Breakfast and dinner are generous and delicious and served, according to weather changes, on the terrace or in the dining room. This is my second trip to Skoura and to Mohammed's kasbah and I enjoyed it again very much! As we arrived too late for breakfast and too early for dinner, Mohammed was nice enough to serve us upon request a nice snack. Fatima, his wife, took care of my dirty clothes without charging us for extra! Besides that Mohammed was very kind to show us his stall with cows, goats, donkeys and sheep. As usual we were very happy to visit and would have stayed longer if the weather wasn't so cold. Until the next time - thank you very much!…",5.0
"We were booked into this hotel by a very well-known driver for hire who assured us he could get us better prices on all of our accommodations than we could get because of his relationship with the hotel owners. This was the first stop on our trip, and we enjoyed every moment at the hotel. We received the bill and thought it was a little bit expensive compared to other places we had visited, but did not think it was outrageous, and since it was the same price our driver had quoted, we didn't think anything of it. The next night I looked up the hotel to see how much of a discount we had received, and was surprised to see that we had paid almost twice the rate that was quoted on TripAdvisor and on other accommodation-booking websites. I realize that this is ultimately my own fault, but I just want to warn anyone staying here to carefully check their bills and compare the cost with what's quoted online before paying.…",2.0
"This stay wa already my second stay in this family-run guest house in the heart of Palmerai in Skoura and it was certainly not the last! The rooms are very cosy, clean and nice and the price is very good (we payed as little20 EUR for full-board and air-conditioned single room) and the rooftop-terrace offers the most scenic views I have ever seen. Furthermore Mohammed and his family are very helpful, provide insights in local life and their home-cooked food is just delicious!",5.0
"Najib found us in our car down the road at skoura. He took us to this charming dar in the Old part of skoura where we had lunch on a terras overlooking the palmerie oase. The lunch was very Nice, best seasoning of meat and good priced! After the meal najib took us for a tour through the Oasis and told us all kind of things about all the plants and the life in the Oasis! We did not sleep at the dar since we where already staying somewhere else, but if we come back to morocco again (inshallah) we Will defenitly come back to dar dmana again! Thank you (shukran) Najib for your hospitality! We Will defenitly recommened your dar to people who are going to skoura! ",4.0
"We choose this place on our way to Marrakesh, traveling from Fez. We wanted to stay in Ouarzazate, but accommodations were more expensive there and at a lower rate, so it was the best decision.   This place was authentic, with nice view, and joyful decors. We were pleasantly surprised by the food, cooked in the house, by the family, and the roof terrace and inside dining room, made the whole experience incredible. There was a nice sense of perfume in the room, which was, by the way, really spacious for three people.  It was a bit occurred the lack of the bathroom door, but Mohammed was really nice and let us use an external one. This didn't influence at all our stay there, and we would definitely recommend it to some others.  There is a possibility to rent a bike, really cheap, and ride around palm tree plantations, which is a good option if you have enough time.…",5.0
"Very pleasant, comfortable small hotel run by Mohammed and his family. Pretty rooms with their own bathrooms. We were made very welcome. Mohammed's father took us next door to see the new born lambs in their pen and we played with the puppy. Food is fine and served either on the terrace or in the restaurant with its riot of tiling.  Dar Dmana makes a good base for exploring the palmerie. You don't need a car - you can hire a bicycle or like us, do it on foot. A GPS on the phone is useful for finding your way around the winding paths. Initially this can be a difficult place to find, especially if you arrive in the dark, so would recommend new visitors arrive in the daylight.  During our stay we amused ourselves by checking out some of the other alternative accommodation , and Dar…",4.0
"This place was fantastic, felt like home, very charming, with a beautiful terrace with great view of the surrounding oasis.  The indoor restaurant space was also lovely (a little cold in December) with intricate decor.    The location was great, off the beaten track, in an old village of Kasbahs in old Skoura.  It gives one a real sense of what it is like in smaller towns/villages in Morocco.  We really enjoyed walking around the village in the evening/night, picking up supplies in the little corner store, seeing the architecture, and agriculture in the village.  We felt quite safe there.  We had hot water shower and a space heater in the room which kept it warm enough in Dec.  The rooms had authentic skin rugs and berber blankets.  I wouldn't say it was the cleanest…",5.0
"This is a calm, relaxing family-run hotel in the ""palmeraie""/palm groves with a gorgeous view to M´Goun. I enjoyed my stay here a lot!  It´s a very good alternative to hotels in the rather anonymous Ouarzazate. Grand Taxis are available in Ouarzazate at the petrol station at the exit street of town, towards Skoura.

"Firstly, well done if you find the place as it is a few unnavigable kilometres along a dirt track outside the town, but they will come and meet you.  It is in the heart of a working village.  We arrived in the dark but Mohammed immediately organised food and drink and we had a BBQ on the roof top dining area.  The place is fairly basic as it appears to be a few rooms set aside from a working farmhouse but everything appeared to work, it was tranquil and clean.  The rooms had a certain individual style which we found charming.  What was the best part was Mohammed and his family.  They are wonderfully and genuinely friendly and cannot do enough to make you comfortable.  The food was fantastic and all freshly prepared by his family.  Apparently Much of it is grown on the farm or…",5.0
"We arrived at Skoura hoping to find a quite place to rest. What we experienced at the Dmana guesthouse was far more what we expected. The first thing was the authentic, not hidden-interest -driven hospitality and helpfulness. Mohamed was truly concerned about our needs when it came to food, hot water, directions, exploring the area. At the end we decided to stay there three nights and don't regret it at all! It is so far our best family run guesthouse that we have been into. Highly recommended! If we ever come back to this area of Morocco, surely we will stay there again.",5.0
"We find this guest house by pure luck when we arrived at Skoura. My son and I were warmly welcomed by Mohamed and the whole family. We stayed one night on our way to Merzouga but we loved the place and the family so much that we came back to stay an other three nights when traveling back to Marrakech. The rooms are well decorated, clean and the showers hot! We hired bikes (quite basic) for a small cost and spent two of our three days exploring the palmeraie. The family is lovely and actually we spent lots of time with them, playing board games, biking and chatting. They serve berber diners which are very tasty and my son who is 8, found the chicken the best in the world!

We got a wonderful tour of the surrounding Palm grove including a spectacular huge abandoned old Kasbah nearby and an insight into how the land is cleverly worked and irrigated .

We did not have an en-suite so we had to share a bathroom, but the room was large and comfortable. The food was good and the breakfast on the terrace was lovely.

"This spot is so incredibly unique and it was a perfect way to end an adventurous two weeks of backpacking in Morocco.  Please Note: This is Auberge Famille Ben Moro. Next door is Kasbah Ben Moro. While both are part of the same complex, they are run separately.  Location: The hostel/auberge is surrounded by a palmerie oasis with the snow-capped mountains in the distance. It's beyond picturesque.  Wi-Fi: Strong wi-fi only in the front reception area. You can sit in the reception room to use.   Staff:  It is run by very friendly family staff. While sitting by the pool writing post cards I was invited to join a family member his friend for afternoon tea. They are very respectful of guests different wants. I let them know I was simply here to relax at the end of my trip and they were extremely appreciative of that. They recommended some walks in the nearby palmerie and otherwise left me to relax.  Rooms: Basic rooms with ensuite toilet & shower. I had a double bed, two bedside tables, a writing desk, and a small sitting table with two chairs where I could eat dinner in the evenings if I ate in my room.  Restaurant : they do have a restaurant and an outdoor terrace sitting area where breakfast is served [the staff encouraged me to sit in the morning sun with the palmerie & mountains in the distance. It was a perfect, tranquil way to start the day!].  However, due to the limited number of guests, they basically offer a plat du jour, not a full menu. I'm absolutely certain that if you let them know early in the day of any dietary restrictions or preferences that they would prepare accordingly. I visited in winter & the staff offered to bring my meal to my room (and I may have actually been the only guest that night!) which completely warmed both me & my room on a cold winter night! It was a gorgeous beef tanjine, vegetable soup, and oranges. I devoured it!  100 dirhams per meal paid at check-out.  As many others have stated, for a place to just get away and relax in serenity, I could have stayed longer & I honestly didn't want to leave.  -------------------------------------------------------- Getting There: In Ouarzazate get to the gare routière.

The kasbah has signs and will be on the left side of the road. The shared taxi will cost 15 dirhams.…",5.0
"This is a great place to stay with lovely views from the terrace, but make sure you check for bedbugs before sleeping there.  Rooms are basic, but spacious. Good, ample breakfast eaten on the terrace is a nice way to start the day.  Dinners at sunset are nice, too, though a bit pricey.",3.0
"We stayed one night in Skoura and were really happy at Auberge Famille Ben Moro. Do not confuse this place with Kasbah Ben Moro next door  After a long hot day we arrived to cool rooms, a pool and a rooftop terrace with spectacular sunset views over the palmerie with the Atlas mountains behind.  The room was fairly basic but it was clean and the whole building is authentically Moroccan.   Finally, the family who run the place are lovely.",4.0
"We just had lunch at the ben moro hotel. Quite difficult to find a restaurant during the day during ramadan, so we were happy that the hotel would serve us a small lunch. He only had one small salad (cucumber, tomato and onion mix) and one berber omelet. It came without bread as he had no bread. For drink we had one coffee (nescafe solution) and a bottle of water. We enjoyed the lunch as we were hungry, the views were wonderful and the host was friendly. However, he charged us 100 dirham for the lunch that would bot have costed more then 50 dirham anywhere else in morroco. Go here for the nice view but do not forget to negotiate the price before sitting down to have a meal.",3.0
"We are a family of 5 (three kids aged 15, 13 & 9) and we loved this place - a great stop on the way to the Sahara. The view from the terrace was lovely and the pool was a huge added bonus, which we had to ourselves because it was so quiet. The rooms were comfortable and the food was delicious. Thank you to Driss and his family for a lovely stay and thanks too for showing us how you cook with the tagine.",5.0
"Tucked out the way, north of Ouarzazate and a stone's throw from the Sahara, Skoura is a traditional unspoilt place with a great palm oasis with random Kasbahs, some in ruins, others beautifully restored. One Kasbah is run by Driss Benmoro and is open for tourists who wish for a bit of real-life Morocco. Delicious food, lovely mint tea and a fine swimming pool, topped off with great views over the oasis to the snowy Atlas Mountains. The rooms are basic but that's all you need. It's best to have a car (although Driss does lend out his bike!)  Important note: if you are not keen on the long twisty (and entertaining) drive from Marrakech, fly to Ouarzazate airport and Driss can collect you (or you can rent a car there.) Tips for tourists: Drive to the Sahara sand dunes of Merzouga - but you'll need more than a day to do it.…",5.0
"We so very much enjoyed our two night stay at this Kasbah and wished we would have stayed longer. The friendliness of the brothers Moro, the attentiveness, the great food, the Kasbah itself, the surroundings, the view and the silence are unforgettable. But mostly how must we felt at home, there. We would, and will, recommend this to anyone. When you go and stay there, ask to rent bikes and a guide and go through the valley with dade trees and the oldest Kasbah in the area; an awesome experience, which we will never forget.",5.0
We arrived here late on rainy day and had been upgraded to a suite. We were traveling with another couple and we took the second floor suite and they took the top floor. Both were amazingly big but theirs was shocking. It had its own living room with fireplace and two other rooms. The walls are thick and the windows small so it takes some getting use to but very unique place. Dining was indoors ( rather dull and dark room) due to the weather. I was ill with cold so kitchen fixed me some soup and dessert to eat in room but my husband and our friends thought it was one of the best meals of the trip even though after 8 days in Morocco we were at the end of our tagine tolerance level. Pretty place and probably even more special in great weather. Be prepared to climb some steep…,4.0
"Famille Ben Moro it's a splendid kasbah located in the beautiful palmeraie de Skoura. The family who owns and runs the auberge it's most kind and will provide you with everything you could need.

"Hi all  I stayed two times at the Kasbah Zitoune in Ouarzazate. I've been a few times in Morocco and in my opinion, this is one of the best place to stay in Ouarzazate The location of Tifoultoute, 2 km from the city center is perfect to relax, in the middle of the palm trees, and far away from the crowd of the town The place is huge, with a massive patio, with some friendly animals The bedrooms are beautifull and built in a typical moroccan style  The food is very typical too, with genuine Moroccan cuisine, yummy :-) The team is simply awesome, friendly and kind. I never had such a good welcome. They are simple peoples, very down to earth and love their work and take care of the place. All is neat and tidy To finish, you can enjoy beautifull sunset, with marvellous view on the snowy atlas in the middle of the desert : Stunning and astundishing Claudie and  Lachen can organise some 4 WD tours too, the best of the region, with very skilled drivers who knows very well the traditions and the most beautifull places So don't hesitate to book, this is a very good place and very good service for this price, don't miss it Eric…",5.0

There was one very friendly guy, he was the first we saw. But the managing lady was not very friendly, nor were some of the other staff.  At night, when we were using the wifi in the reception area, the manager left. Less than one minute later, the remaining person ordered is out of the reception area because he was turning off the lights. Not very friendly, is was only 21:30. We did not feel very welcome...",3.0
"What a nice place to stay! From the kasbah you have wonderfull views over the surrounding. The kasbah is well maintened and very clean.  We just met Claudi, her husband was away for a few days. She is a very nice lady who keeps an eye on everything.( is everything oké? did you have a good sleep? ) We ate in the kasbah too, a very nice 3 course dinner for a very reasonble price.  It is a bit difficult to get to the Kasbah without a car, however, they will pick you up from the airport or busstation.  We enjoyed our stay very much ,So If you are going to Ouarzazate think about staying in this wonderfull place!",5.0
"Fairly newly built/renovated (?) Kasbah some 7 km outside of Ouarzazate. 400 m of dirt road to get there, but then it stands on its own and offers a quiet retreat from the bustle of the city. Nice rooms, not very fancy, but nice and sparse decor which makes a wonderful blend of traditional style and its modern interpretation. Super nice court yard where peacocks, cats, and dog play together. Roof terrace offers a wonderful view of the night sky somewhat away from the city lights.  Very friendly and flexible personnel/owners. Dinner can be requested and is good even if not fancy, breakfast is the typcial French/Morocan mix-style.",5.0
"If you prefer inedible food, no light by which to read at night, sandpaper towels, Febreeze-scented everything, pillows for Lilliputians, no soap or shampoo, the necessity of showering at night only, when there is SOME hot water, then go right ahead and stay here. Otherwise, stay far, far away--unless you're French, to whom the owners cater. They refused to give our (Berber) guide a room unless he went away and returned after 8 pm. I found that tantamount to apartheid. The dinner and breakfast were inedible--we got warm squash salad and Uncle Ben's rice. The French guests got spaghetti, which indeed did not seem all that much better than our meal. If you go during warm season, be aware that the AC shuts off moments after it goes on. There is no relief from the heat.",1.0
"Thanks to our driver we found this wonderfull kasbah, close to Quarzazate.  Staff is friendly, service, food and beds are great.   Highly recommended. I will certainly return!",5.0
The owners have built this atmospheric kasbah from scratch in traditional style.   Travelling independently by car it was a little hard for us to find but well worth it. Its really quite stunning.  Our room was very spacious and it gives you an idea what it must have been like to live in an original kasbah. The ceilings are made of reeds and the basins in our ensuite were beaten copper. Breakfast is served in the central courtyard where a couple of peacocks kept us company. The peacocks somehow seemed appropriate. The dining room is also atmospheric and we found the meals very good.   One of the good things about travelling in Morocco is the variety of accommodation. This was a good example of a really interesting place to stay and good value for money.,5.0

"If you have the misfortune to get off the bus at Ouarzazate, then be sure that you have booked a seat for your onward destination (probably Merzouga or Zagora) the next day!  Shown on Wikipedia as a ""tourist destination"" and the ""gateway to the desert"", Ouarzazate (with a population of only around 70,000!) doesn't even do justice to being called a town never mind a city!   The only thing going for it is the fantastic 4 hour coach trip from Marrakech and its breathtaking views along the route through the Atlas Mountains. The 80 dirham (£6.25) trip was excellent value for money with Supratours or CTM and tickets can easily be booked & paid for in advance on line - be sure to book early and reserve the front row seats for the best views! (Warning - no refunds are available using CTM but as Supratours is part of ONCF Moroccan Rail Company, refunds are available should your plans change!)   The facilities for tourists in Ouarzazate are extremely limited and probably the only reason to get off the bus here is to visit nearby World Heritage Aït Benhaddou (World Heritage Site) which is 30km away! Ironically the buses from Marrakech pass through Tazentout (10km from Aït Benhaddou) but don't stop there to even ""set down"") so it's a wasted extra 40km round trip in a taxi to ""double back"" to reach Aït Benhaddou - but definitely a place to visit (& stay) rather than the ""city"" of Ouarzazate which has nothing to offer tourists except a visit to its overpriced film studios - prices that would be more akin to Hollywood and not a small town in Morocco!   A taxi for up to 6 people costs 250 dirham from Hotel Zaghro to Aït Benhaddou (30 minutes journey time) which includes a 90 minute wait to bring you back! On arrival at Aït Benhaddou we managed a walk to the top of the Ksar (stopping to take photos on the way) and back in 45 minutes so an hour and half stop should we sufficient including a tea/coffee at any of the cafes in the area!   The Hotel Zaghro is located 3km from the centre of Ouarzazate - this in itself is a point to take into account. The cheap ""petit taxis"" that ply the centre of Ouarzazate at 7 dirhams a trip (55p) per person are not allowed this far out and so a ""grande taxi"" must be used which will only ""leave when full""! As a group of 5 this was no problem as we paid the 6 seat cost of almost €4 a trip. But if you are alone or just a couple, then staying at the Hotel Zaghro will add an additional cost to your stay for each journey made if you don't want to wait for the, taxi to fill.   The hotel struggles to even get its 2 star status! Also don't be fooled by the photographs of the exterior and the rooms - they certainly are a lot smaller in reality than the images shown portray - amazing what a good camera lens can achieve!!! It lies on the main street in a suburban area of Ouarzazate with little to offer tourists in general!   The facilities in the rooms are basic and clean but definitely late 20th century and if you need an electric power point to charge a phone, then make sure you bring a 6 metre cable with you!!!   The twin room had 2 power points which was acceptable but the 4 bedded room had no power points visible at all except for the ones the air conditioning were connected to and the TV socket, both of which were just about reachable if you stood on the bed! By the way - both TV's in our 2 rooms did not work and would not be ""out of place"" in the Cinema Museum in the centre of town and most probably satellite TV had not even been invented when these TV's were made!!! In the 4 bedded room we eventually discovered another socket but this was only found ""by accident"" when one of the beds was moved as it was completely hidden from sight and was nowhere near any mirror! For 4 people the room was far too small and should be classed as a ""small twin"" never mind 2 singles & a double!   The ""en suite"" facilities were the usual cramped 1990's style and the hot water tap had to be left running for 10 minutes before anything considered ""warm"" could be used for washing or taking a shower!   Don't be fooled by the hotel description which is not entirely accurate! The air conditioning and WiFi (& pool) were the only things positive to say about this hotel - they worked well! The use of the word ""restaurant"" in the title and ""gastronomic"" in the description are not exactly accurate and leave much to the imagination!   Rooms with a balcony are a little far fetched! Large ""window box"" would be more accurate as there was not even the width for one person and a chair and due to the position of the Hotel, the sun never shines on the balcony anyway, so it really serves little purpose! The balconies seemed to be used as ""perches"" by the local pigeon population as a staging post judging by the amount of uncleaned ""pigeon droppings"" to be found on the balcony floor and their constant ""cooing"" outside the window from 6am in the morning meant a ""lie in"" was impossible!!!   As a ""tourist destination"" (so the publicity for Ouarzazate describes itself) even during the month of Ramadan, for non Muslim visitors, there was virtually nothing available compared to the facilities and services offered at Morocco's other more ""famous"" cities and tourist spots.   Despite the Hotel 'Restaurant' Zaghro showing ""breakfast included"" in the price, the reception said this did not apply during Ramadan here!!!   The Carrefour Supermarket in the centre of town seemed the only suitable 21st century shopping facility in town but even here, the ""wines & spirits"" section was closed completely during the month of Ramadan!   So, all in all, Ouarzazate and the Hotel Zaghro didn't encourage a longer stay but were fine as an overnight stop due to the limited visitor facilities available in general.   …",3.0

It was probably just bad timing, but they were doing a construction project where they were tracking dirt across the main tiled courtyard... this meant that sitting in the courtyard was unpleasant and the large and otherwise attractive pool was lined in dirt (and there were gross bird feathers and other things floating in the pool too).  Because the courtyard was not enjoyable due to the construction, we spent time in our room.  The view from our room was of a construction site, and there was a lot of noise from the project.

Stuff speaks French - and only very little English - and no Spanish at all. So if you have a problem, you should speak proper French. Otherwise ""I don't understand"" is the most common phrase you'll hear. In my case they charged me more for the room than it was offered and reserved through their website.

When I returned, I asked Youssef at www.desert-trips.com to make the booking for me. I was given a twin room that overlooked the pool. The room was very clean and I stayed two nights. The room was cleaned and bed made while I was there; this is not always the case in Morocco. Breakfast was included with room price and supper was extra. I opted for room service and was served a delicious meal. There is wifi service available and the connection was good.",5.0

I believe the newer rooms are okay but we arrived at a busy time and could only get one of the older rooms.  It was freezing cold and extremely noisey. The shower was over the bath and the hot water took forever to come on. There were cockroaches on my pillow when I went to go to bed.  If you're at all particular about sleeping with bugs I wouldn't recommend it. ,1.0

Nice stopover on the drive on the way to Marrakech from a day in Aït Benhaddou and Ouarzazate. Easy to find on the main road. Great staff and food. Only negative is WiFi comes off mobile network so it is slower than if you use your cell phone from the tables in front of the building. Secure private parking next to the building.,4.0
"On the way to Marrakech we decided that we will spend one more night in the Atlas. And it was something to remember. The hotel was beautiful and clean, the staff was weary friendly, and the food was one of the best in the whole trip to Morocco. Also the prices are in the reasonable range, comparing to what you get for your money. It is also great place if you like hiking. There is a loot to be seen.   Thank you again for everything, see you next time.",5.0
"We were traveling back to Marrakech from Ouarzazate, where we had lost our hotel reservation. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise because we decided to stop at a Kasbah along the road and came upon the Kasbah Imini. What a fantastic find.! The rooms were very comfortable, clean and quiet. The patio and gardens were such a tranquil respite from our travels to the desert, and Hassan was the perfect host. Together with his brother they whipped up a delicious supper which was very nicely served in the indoor courtyard. Our conversations with Hassan were very interesting and enlightening as we experienced life in the local berber village. We highly recommend this wonderful place on your journeys in Morocco.  Adele New York City",5.0
We came across this restaurant/hotel after travelling for hours by motorbike. Gorgeous place for a break. Spotless toilet facilities and the option to eat on the terrace or in the indoor courtyard to cool down. Wholesome delicious food & very reasonable. Friendly owner & great views. Would highly recommend Kasbah Imini. Sonya Ireland,5.0

"I stayed at Cinema Riad with two colleagues for two nights in January 2020 and think I can speak for all of us that we thoroughly enjoyed our time here.  The highlight was Abdourafi (sp), who was available all day, every day to assist us with countless questions and requests.  He always had a smile on his face and went above and beyond, even going to get us bread at 10 pm on a Thursday to ensure we would have breakfast before our departure the following morning (being Friday, restaurants would be opening after we left).    We all shared one of the rooms with 3 single beds.  It was tight (naturally), but comfortable enough.  Like most riads in Morocco, this one was very cold...at least in winter...but we were lucky to have use of a small heater for our room, as well as a heater in the lobby/dining room when we were there.  The terrasse view is very nice, especially for sunrise (I imagine sunset is also nice, though we weren't there for it).  It's nice to see the splashes of color: green palm trees, brown houses and mountains, and pink and blue skies.    We had dinner (chicken couscous and harrira soup) our first night and breakfast both mornings and they were really good.  In fact, the dinner was exponentially better than the one we had in town our second night.  The breakfast is simply bread, cheese, and jam, with coffee, tea, and milk.  We asked to have an omelette on our last night for breakfast the following morning and Abdourafi happily complied.    The amenities themselves were standard.  The men's bathroom had hot water which was wonderful after being outside in the cold all day; my female colleague said the water was only warm in the women's bathroom.  There is only one bathroom for each gender in the entire riad, so it's important to note that that is a shared space.  We were the only guests during our visit, so this wasn't an issue.  For those interested, I saw two bikes available to rent (I believe for 12/euros for the day).    Overall, it was a very nice stay, and I'd happily recommend it to anyone passing through Ouarzazate for a few days and would likewise stay again myself.…",5.0
"We stayed here one night and enjoyed the very kindness of the whole staff. Laugh, smiles are always part of the house and we directly felt comfortable! We also received great advice to eat in the city and do a 3 days guided tour to the desert. +very clean and good breakfast :)",5.0
"Stayed here one night on our way to M'Hamid. Coming from the busy streets of Marrakech. it was a delight to visit Cinema Riad and the more quiet and low key part of Ourzazate. Have some tea cookies on the main road and observe the local life. Cinema Riad is a bit challenging to find, but that makes is even more exciting! The Riad is beautifully designed, pretty rugs on the walls & many nice movie details. We enjoyed the roof terrace with its gorgeous views.",5.0
"Stayed here for two nights while visiting ouarzazate. Cool place in the an cinema style with old cameras. Very friendly staff, they made me a very tasty tagine on my 1st night. They have a nice rooftop with great views of the oasis right in front. The rooms only lack outside windows, but it has to do with the style of the building. Defenitely recommended!",4.0
"The only drawback of Cinema Riad (being a 10 dirham drive from Ouarzazate) is counterbalanced by the fact that it lies in the heart of a small, genuine village: Tabounte. Even though it is not as quiet and quaint as you might expect after seeing Chefchaouen, it is by all means as Moroccan as can be, so far unspoiled by tourism.   The hostel itself offers everything a backpacker might want. Spacious and clean rooms, bathrooms. And, to boot, filling (and in seemingly unlimited quantities) breakfast. Rifa who is in charge of the hostel 24 hours a day will be happy to join you for a tea and #cookies on the terrace, advise you on your future endeavors and contaminate you with his meek yet radiant kindness.  Totally worth a visit. 9 out of 10. Just because washing your clothes is a bit expensive as every piece i charged separately. So just wash your sock in the shower and let them dry in the scorching sun. You'll save enough to take a taxi to the Ksab, there and back again.  Oh, and if you happen to wake around dawn, don't hesitate to walk up to the terrace. Sunrise is stunning.   So yes, worth a go!…",5.0
Very friendly and clean. The view is beautiful and they will help you in any way they can. The connection to ouarzazate is very good but you will still feel that you are in a little town. It's a very good place to start into the Sahara or discover the local kasbahs.,5.0

"Raffi welcomes us as we were part of the family.  He and the all atmosphere is really friendly. We were there for 2 nights and we felt like at home. Service is good and bedrooms are very clean (we splept in a 6-place bedroom). If you ask Raffi, you can have the possibility to smoke a Sischa and at the same time to drink a very good and very hot tee. The Riad is located 5 min from Ouarzatate village, that you can easily reach with a vehicule. It was definitely a pleasure!",5.0
"A fairly new place and I was delighted to find it. My favourite hostel in Morocco so far. Wonderful warm welcome. Abdul and the staff here are excellent. Great guy. The folk that were here also made this place for me. Brilliant time with beautiful people! Follow signs for Zagora if walking and ye can ask folk like i did. Its a tricky find all in all though. I walked from Supratours Station but Abdul actually came and got me at Tourist Office after a bit of confusion with direction. I would urge anyone to CTM bus to the Ouarzarate (When coming from Marrakesh like I did) as its much closer to the hostel. Better to get a taxi on first arrival if coming from Supratours station. The hostel a fair distance away from Ouarzarate. Around 2km(Not very far really but depends on your want to walk)  But it's actually perfect,in a small hub next to a school and has a feel of real Morocco as you make your way to hostel from your day. It was worth the walk. Great folk running the place, with an open and friendly nature. Real laughs. Enjoy!…",5.0
"An exceptional point of view on the city of Ouarzazate and its breathtaking environment. The hosts are warm and sincere. Cinema lovers can find something to choose from in the decoration. If you you have a rental, this spot is very convenient for parking! Abdel was a consummate host -  we decided to stay in, to eat a wonderful dinner in the riad! We had a great time chatting away in the main lounge after. Our room was clean, neat and comfortable, and the washrooms/toilets were good too. The place has a terrace with incredible views back towards the Atlas , à la prochaine!",5.0
Cinema Riad is a unique and beautiful place in Ouarzazate. The property is set in a building from the 19th century and this building was the main house of one of the notables of the region. The property is ideally located between the beautiful valley of Tabount in Ouarzazate and the splendid mountains of the High Atlas. Cinema Riad is tastefully decorated with the theme of the cinema. Ouarzazate is the Hollywood of morocco where many movies are created. Our hospitality and authenticity will provide - a unique experience. Excursions to the desert and Hight Atlas can be organized upon request.,5.0
"4 British birders used this hotel for 4 nights and from the moment we arrived until our departure Abdou and his family were absolutely fantastic. The hospitality, food, genuine friendliness and helpfulness  was better than any of us have ever received.  We did not eat out at all! All meals were superb, very well priced, home cooked and authentic. Credit to Fatma -  and her eldest daughter whom baked us cakes!  The basic accommodation is very traditional, well furnished and spacious.   Abdou could not do enough for us; from supplying mint tea and dates on our daily returns to doing our washing to removing scratches from our hire car that we had collected!  I would not hesitate to stay here from with Abdou and his beautiful family.",5.0
"We stayed with Abdou and his family on our way to Marrakech. They are the nicest and friendliest people we've met during our trip. We were even invited to attend the birthday party of Abdou's daughter who just turned 16. It was a cool experience and a fun way to get to know Moroccan culture.  Besides all that, everything else was good too. The room was clean, the bed was soft, there is a hairdryer,  the shower was nice and had hot water. There even was a heater wich is nice if you visit in december. We had dinner and breakfast,  both were delicious.   Thank you Abdou and all of your family members.",5.0
We stopped here on a road trip of Southern Morroco. Although it has a website and calls itself a hotel it is more of a B&B and reservations are handled by booking.com.  The unique part is that we were given a whole floor of the building which consisted of a huge living room and our choice of bedrooms. Abdou was a wonderful host and our room came with a delicious home cooked tajine for dinner and a generous breakfast.,5.0
"The experience at this riad has been one of the most authentic and traditional that i have had. Amazing family and very caring. The food was delicious and conditions in the rooms perfect. Will go back here again with my family.  On a sidenote, they do not know what being vegetarian is...so try to discuss it with them prior to your visit or on the day you arrive, they will try and cook something different.",5.0

This place is in dire need of a complete renovation. I would never want to stay in this hotel again!",1.0
"On approaching the hotel I was afraid it was deserted. At least it looked that way. It is a big complex and it must have been a splendid cluster of buildings in its time. But this must have been a long time ago.  The hotel building surrounds a large central court with a pool. There are a number of staircases leading to a few rooms each, the rooms are numbered erratically, so that one must be lucky to find the right one. And of course, one is looking for the room with their luggage, because there are NO ELEVATORS! Well, practically it would be impossible to have them as the rooms are totally dispersed.  The room, like the hotel as a whole, was spacious enough, but everything in it was old, old ... Not only new equipment, the hotel is also in urgent need of repairs, beginning with broken tiles and going on endlessly.  The staff was polite, the food was not as good as in other hotels of the same rank in Morocco. There was not much choice and the restaurant was lit so poorly that we could hardly see what to take. The choice at breakfast was also very limited, mostly to butter and very sweet jam. There was some quite stale pastry, too. Really not good enough for a four star hotel, even in Morocco.…",3.0
"Well located. Very nice pool and courtyard. Rooms are outdated, not clean, awful smell. Dinner offering is dull and food not fresh. Breakfast - below minimum standard. The place has a great potential but a substantial overhaul is required.",2.0
"Well, the hotel consists in fact of several buildings surrounding a central pool and loisir space.This is at first floor, not ground floor compared with the hotel entrance. Rooms are at first and second floor, and there is no elevator. But for a small tip, somebody can carry your luggage up. sometimes is a bit more complicated to follow the path to your room - please watch carefully the signs.  Rooms are classic, not too much to expect. Furniture is old and a bit odd(some  wrought iron as mirrors fraims or nightstands). a lot of different combinations of furniture in the rooms and on the common spaces, not necessary working well together.  Bathroom - nothing to expect, as always in Moroccco.  A lot of noise in the night from the central common area around the pool.  wi fi is available only at ground floor in the lobby and at the bar.  Dinner was ok, lot of choices and deserts.  for breakfast, not to much to say, as usual plates get empty quick and you have to ask to be refilled.…",3.0
"Not very great. The building itself is actually really beautiful, just as the garden/pool area. However the hotel could really use some renovations; everything is really outdated and old. Breakfast was really really really poor and terrible service (and believe me my standards aren't that high). Hotel was full of selfie-obsessed loud asians who started screaming at each other at 6AM. Location of the hotel is good as it is in a very nice and quiet area!",2.0
"We loved this hotel. The rooms were all over the place with a central pool and sitting out area. The food was good: buffet-style. Our room was comfortable, once we figured out the lights!  There is no elevator, but the porters are very attentive to carry bags up the stairs to your room. In the evening it could be a bit noisy, but soon settled down, and was then quite quiet. The mattress was comfortable and the pillows soft. The air was perfumed with the scent from orange trees planted here and there. A charming, unpretentious hotel.",4.0

The beds were not good and so we had little sleep. On the first visit dinner was a buffet which was really good with lots of choice. On the second visit it was a set meal which was very average. Breakfast was a buffet on both occasions and again the second buffet was very limited. Wi-Fi only worked in the lobby. We had some laundry done which was very good and cheap!

"We stayed here as part of a tour. It's within walking distance of the Kasbah, so in a perfect location for that site. I had a perfect night of sleep after taking a hot bath. The lobby is old-school and reminded me of some hotels in Syria, reflecting more the 1940s or 50s; it grew on me with a certain authentic charm. Bathrooms were nice, and as others pointed out the pool area was also nice though too cold for us to use. The internet worked well. When a light did not work, they fixed it immediately (within 1 minute of my notice), fairly remarkable!  The dining area was well-appointed.

The steps led to a courtyard which was beautifully landscaped with a huge pool.  We walked past the pool into another building to find our room.  It was large with a large bathroom and beautifully tiled floors.  No problems here! (Except the bed, like most Moroccan beds was very hard.)

"We were booked into this hotel as part of a tour group, for two nights.  There was no elevator, and a lot of stairs. The rooms were filthy. Some of our group reported cockroaches in their rooms. Our room had a tiled floor in bathroom and bedroom, which appeared not to have been swept, let alone washed, in a long time. On our first day, the group had lunch in the restaurant, which I thought fine at the time, until 4.15am, when the gastro enteritis kicked in. The air conditioning did not work. There was more water coming out of the hose than the shower head, towels were grey, not white.  Room and bathroom was very tired. I was not well enough to eat breakfast next  morning, but my wife reported that it was extremely poor. The whole group booked out next day, the tour operator…",1.0
"The location of the hotel is good, close to Kasbah Taourirt (we enjoyed a concert in the square facing the Kasbah). The inner courtyard with the pool is very nice, unfortunatey we did not have much time to enjoy it properly (and the temperature in the first half of March was not so high either). The decoration of the hotel was nice (although a bit worn out). What was not so convenient, was the lack of elevators and ramps, so people had to drag their suitcases to ther rooms using the staircase. What was truly shocking, was the breakfast. The hotel is very big and there is a huge amount of people trying to have breakfast at the same time. The waiters brought food only very lttle at a time. For example they only brought two jars of orange juice but there was at least 30 people…",3.0

In the lobby we saw trays with food leftovers of who stayed there for hours Except fore the luggage boy and the receptionist the staff was, lazy, unfriendly and sometimes aggressive  The food wasn't tasty.

Given large double room despite my booking single standard, which although being moderately furnished was comfy and clean.

"We were actually there in February 2009, but I didn't get a chance to write a review before tonight - sorry! However, I did want to say that this hotel was nice enough.. Yes, it seems to have seen better days.. It was a bit of faded glory there.. As we were there during the off season, the place was almost empty and that was a bit eerie.. The staff were helpful and our room was nice, but cold.. We had to request extra blankets.. However, there were no ramps back then to wheel our luggage up to the level of the bedrooms; we had to carry it up a flight of steps.. There is one thing, though: the position / location of this hotel made up for any faults - simply superb! The view from the restaurant terrace was absolutely lovely.. Would return to this hotel..",3.0
"We stayed three nights at Le Fint.  Whilst the hotel was obviously quite a plush place when built, our room was perhaps not one of the best, overlooking the next door hotel's staff quarters, pretty cramped, and not particularly clean.  The pool looked lovely from a distance, but was constantly covered by a film of insects and leaves, which didn't seem to be removed at all.  The bar area was ok, and the staff there were fine, but I marked service down as, on the night we arrived, we brought wine into the restaurant from the ar having charged that to our room no problem.  On ordering water in the restaurant, a bottle was brought, but on leaving we were accosted by the Maitre de, who very loudly informed us we would have to pay in cash.  Ok, I was struggling a bit with my French,…",2.0
"While I did not find the Hotel Le Fint particularly new or just opened, it's strange that it was not listed in the Trip Advisor Ouarzazate hotels.  In any case it was a most pleasant four-star hotel at the eastern end of Blvd. Mohammed V, just beyond the Taourit Kasbah (tel. ----).  The hotel complex is built around a central court yard with a medium size pool (the water was freezing the day I tried it).  The restaurant and bar were very nice and the food was wonderful, both dinner and breakfast.  My room was medium sized with two beds and a small balcony overlooking the court yard.  The bathroom was standard.  No hair dryer or minibar.  Post room prices were 500 Dh for a single and 650 Dh for the double. ",4.0
This hotel is so much more than a hotel. It's an opportunity to spend time with a local Moroccan family and truly learn a lot about culture and meet great people. We only spent one night here due to our schedule but if we had the chance we would have definitely stayed much longer. We cooked dinner with the family and learned about Moroccan culture and cooking. The rooms were very comfortable with amazing views. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling through the area. Such a great find! Thank you Mostapha! ,5.0

Plus it is located in a run-don looking area of the city down a dirt road, but this shouldn't put you off.",5.0
"Amazing stay! A wonderfully surprising place in many ways.  Definitely a hostel where having a car is helpful. When we booked we didn't realise quite how far we would be from ouarzazate - it ended up being a 50dh taxi ride from the centre (after thorough bargaining), and down a very poorly lit back road. It is a 10 minute walk from there to the nearest restaurants / shops  (not sure if the hotel provided dinner or not ).  But once through the gates we found an incredibly chilled lush environment, with a beautiful pool and a warm welcome  (despite booking at very late notice only an hour previously). Very beautiful place.   Rooms were reasonably comfy, with decent showers and AC.   The guardian, Mohammed, was incredibly warm and welcoming. He helped us arrange a very reasonably priced car hire for the week and gave us loads of great info about Morocco (especially as this was our first day). All our conversations were in French though, so not sure how well non Arabic and non French speakers would be able to communicate.  Awesome stay and would definitely return! …",5.0

"Maroc Galacx is a nice, welcoming place if you want to spend one or more nights in Ouarzazate.  The hotel is low-budget and basic, but overall clean and well looked after. Double rooms are spacious enough and equipped with ensuite bathroom, A/C and blankets.   There is a nice garden with a poorly maintained pool (the water is a bit brownish and not really attracting) and a couple of terraces from where you can enjoy sunrises and sundowns.  Breakfast is not included and costs 2,50 EUR per person per night. No savory food though, only bread, butter, jam and a few hot drinks. WiFi is present and works fairly well, but only around the reception area.  Momo, the manager, is friendly, helpful and full of advices. He speaks French and a fairly good English.   Beware the hotel is located few kilometres away from the town center. This is not an issue if you have your own transportation, but it might be a problem if you travel on foot or by public transport. A car park is available at the premises.…",4.0

Momo recommended Ait Benhaddou to us for a visit and i'm so glad he did - we would have skipped it otherwise - so worth the effort as it really is a beautiful area.

"I have traveled the world as a group meeting and incentive trip planner and this was by far one of the coolest experiences of my life. This 15 tent ""ecolodge"" hotel offers you the definition of SOLITUDE and a chance to learn from and live like a Berber nomadic family.    The host family at this tented camp has a passion for life and a hunger to host. We arrived as the sun was setting for a walk around their ""camp"" where they have set up their life. Then we enjoyed a wonderful meal made from fresh vegetables they have grown, wine and lovely meats all set at a linen-clad and china-decorated table.  After dinner, we laid under the stars and enjoyed our friends for hours prior to retiring in our well-appointed tents, complete with sinks, european toilets and ""showers"".   What an experience to live like this nomadic family - truly life changing.…",5.0
"In a month trip around Morocco, hitting all the major sites, etc… nothing comes close to the experience that we had at this Ecolodge.  Not easy to find (either to book, or to actually arrive) located in this beautiful slice of scrub land, close to Ouarzazate but centuries away from civilization, there is no better place to experience desert (not dunes) and a real oasis.  There is nothing but the berber tents, which will be your accommodation and the main lodge, where you will eat and decompress from the limitless scenery.  The hosts, Mohammad and family, are just amazing- they become your family while you are there; you can help with meal preparation, lead you on in-depth walks and explain the history of both his family and the berbers.  But the true kicker is, you are free to roam around, no stress, only you and the limitless stars… Not budget, but it shouldn't be...…",5.0
"We had a wonderful experience. The accommodation is basic, beds not too comfortable and little light. Hot water worked well. But the Gorgeous location, the friendliness of the staff, the delicious natural food and the flexibility compensated for the relative roughness. We went for a 4 hour ( return) hike to a nearby village ( where the film Babel was shot) , and ate at a local family home. It was delicious and fantastic for the kids to experience. Our host ( ecolodge manager) was polite, knowledgeable and friendly. We learned a lot, and would go back but at the right price. Also it would be nice that more activities like donkey riding and more board games were readily available. We enjoyed the bread making and cooking demo!",5.0
"This place deserves the best review for the hosts and location. The family running (not owning) the place are friendly, warm, welcoming and makes you feel at home.

"Whilst we didn't stay the night at the ecolodge (we were filming in the beautiful mountains nearby - but the accommodation looked excellent) we did eat a superb meal (one of the best we had in our 3 months working in Morocco in terms of flavours and simple, delicious ingredients) and used this location for shooting over 3 nights.  Not only is this place so beautiful - day and night (and you should see the stars at night!) - but the story of how the lodge came to be, and the aspirations for re-establishing the family village, are fascinating and provide a great sense of being somewhere very special.  Mohammed (who, handily, speaks great English!) and his family are lovely hosts and will no doubt make you feel very at home in the Fint Valley (my personal favourite place in the whole region).…",5.0

"We decided to stay here in order to explore the nearby gorges and thought it would be good location wise -  we were sorely mistaken. There are so many nice B&B and hotels closer to the gorge it turns out and despite this hotel being in a town, there are more or less no restaurants and the few eateries there are, you can't eat out in and feel comfortable if you are a woman. Honestly there was not a female insight anywhere.   The price is quite low so our expectations were not super high, but we were still left very disappointed. The entire hotels hay-day must be more than 10 yeas ago, and now it just comes across as extremely depressing and rundown. Rooms and bathrooms are a haphazard mix of outdated furniture and cracked tiles, but it does have air con. Pool looks like a health hazard with murky waters better left untouched. The worst part was however the hotel restaurant which was our only option if we wanted dinner in that town. The place has the same soul-draining feel and selection as a domestic airport cafeteria and served up some extremely sad tagines that we are pretty sure caused both of us getting severe food poisoning the following days.  Our advice, stay in some of the options on the way to the gorge - it can only be a step up from this and hopefully won't make you sick.…",2.0

The restaurant doesn't look like much but there is parking and you can sit outside. It was late so the owner came out and told us what was available. We were welcomed with homemade olives and then we had tomato and onion salad which was super fresh. For main we had omelette berber and kofta tagine. Both amazing.

"I haven't stayed in anywhere in Skoura before or since so I don't know how this places compares to any others, but I can say that it was good bed for the night and some alright food. The owners were quite hospitable and helped me when I lost my shampoo which I thought was very nice of them.  I would concur with others that we ended up staying here because some guy found us looking lost and suggested we stayed with him. I think he slightly mislead us saying the place we were looking for was far away when it wasn't but oh well - all we were looking for was a bed for the night and some hot showers and it was good on both those counts and it was pretty cheap.",3.0
"We arrived in Skoura late in the evening and whilst outside another hotel we got touted by another hotel owner and got persuaded to come and stay at this hotel. It's was nice at a first glance, and we were just happy to be somewhere for the night. It got really weird when we popped out of our room at about midnight to find the owner standing in the dark outside of our room just staring at us. It was creepy! Something out of a horror film to be honest. Then the next day he tried charging us 20€ each for a pretty terrible dinner that we were told was included in the room, when for that money we could have had a really nice meal in Marrakech. The last straw was when I asked for directions to the Kasbah that was nearby, he refused to help me or tell Me where it was unless I paid him. I couldn't believe it. He's the owner of a guesthouse and his job should be to look after and help his guests. I would suggest staying away from this place, and stay somewhere with an owner who is less creepy and less money hungry. …",1.0
"We were approached by the owner of this Kasbah when we arrived to the taxi stand and Skoura without a booking for that night- a bit dim of us.  The owner seemed nice, the price was right and the photos of the kasbah looked nice, which he said was in the palmarie.  The Kasbah was nice, the room basic but fine and the food was good/average.  What killed it was a ""walk through the palms to the famous Kasbah"" that the owner offered to us.  We said we would like about a 2 hour hike, which he agreed to.  The walk was a big ploy for us to go to his friend`s carpet shop.  We walked along the highway for over 2 hours, dusty, smoky (which subsequently made us sick) all so that he could try to get a commission if we bought a carpet or something- which we did not and have to plead to go back to the hotel- all and all, a 4 hour walk.  And then the kicker, he charged us $30 (300 dirham) the next morning for that ""walk of death"".

"Les Nomades Auberge Skoura  We arrived late at night with no idea where to stay but were met and guided here by a member of the extended family who phoned one of the five brothers who came to fetch us and our luggage with his car. We were extremely relieved to get somewhere where we could sleep after a 12 hour bus journey from Azrou. The Kasbah is like a miniature castle whose walls are largely made of the local mud and straw a traditional building method which has passed the test of time.  It is much better then the modern concrete construction which tends to be cold and damp. We were given a meal at short notice and the staff were very welcoming. We chose to be on the upper floor with a cosy and well lit room with, at last, a light switch over the bed a rarity in this country which saved us having to get out of bed to turn the light off. The shower and bathroom were clean and functioned well. Our best surprise came in the morning when we saw the view from the terrace for the first time. Well away from the town centre in a quiet location the view of the snow-covered Atlas to the North was stunning. Here were tables and chairs and plenty of shade for reading and relaxation. We recommend Les Nomades and would come here again. There is wifi internet access…",5.0
"Although, it was almost low-cost hotel, we spent really nice time in Kasbah Les Nomades in Skoura. The staff was really friendly and attentive, the room was nice and clean.

"Our wonderful guide and driver included this guesthouse on our journey from Merzouga to Marrakech.  We were enchanted by the beautiful landscape which consists of high desert  with stunning vistas of snow capped mountains in the background.   The guesthouse is located in a valley ( oasis) where an abundance of fruit trees grow. We approached the guesthouse on a winding road through the groves.  The guesthouse  is built in the traditional style and our comfortable room was decorated with many Berber items. We were served mint tea by Ahmad, Aziz’s son, on a roof top terrace where we had  a panoramic view of the landscape.  Aziz ( the owner) was extremely kind and welcoming. He invited us to share the Iftar meal ( meal at the sunset to break the fast )  and we were also introduced to his family.   This was a unique experience and we enjoyed it immensely. The family who owns it is extremely welcoming. Please consider a stay in this guesthouse in Skoura! We would highly recommend it.…",5.0

Aziz and his family are wonderful hosts; they offer truly graceful hospitality, they know how to make you comfortable but are not overbearing. We were welcomed with tea and Aziz showed us the ""berber cheers"", walked around the grounds, and had a fantastic dinner.

Aziz, his son and all his family run this place beautifully.They were friendly and helpful and the food was generous and excellent. Our suite was clean and very traditional with niknaks and pot pouri making it feel like a home rather than a hotel, which was lovely. The two terraces offered up the most amazing views and the stars at night were good too. Ideal position to see the Kasbah Amridil,where there was a very interesting official guide who was called Redar. We will stay here again without hesitation.",4.0
This is a family run Maison D'Hote and it is very comfortable but not glamorous. The floors are covered in rugs and the walls with works by a talented naive local artist.

I extended my stay two extra nights because I wasn't ready to join the real world yet .. hiding above the edge of the desert over looking the river and the snow capped mountains.

Isolated and the wind howls around the building reminding you that you are miles from anywhere in gorgeous Skoura. The food is sublime, so much of it! The home made bread, the musicians, the terrace, the terrace dining area, the downstairs dining room, the family who run it are all fabulous. We stayed 3 nights and explored the oasis and chilled out in the huge terrace room. The rooms are lovely and comfortable with interesting traditional locks. A beautiful place with lovely hosts, I could have stayed for ever. Brightly coloured lizards are in the rocks on the way in to the kasbah so look out for them when driving.

The view from the room was phenomenal...a full panoramic of the snow capped atlas mountains. The roof top terrace offers a full panoramic view of the palmere and at night offers some amazing star gazing opportunities.

"Dar Panorama is a little off the beaten track but is well positioned, on a hill overlooking the river and palmerie.  It is a bit of a distance to walk down to the palamerie, but certainly do-able.  We spent the evening walking through the palmerie, discovering ancient ruined kasbahs.    There is large, roof-top terrace, with panoramic views.  Rooms are large, comfortable but basic.  The bathrooms are also basic, designed more-or-less like wet rooms.  Wifi is available, but rather weak.  Dinner was served in the dining room, and was very good, traditional Moroccan cuisine.  Staff were very friendly and welcoming.",4.0

We highly recommend this place.,4.0
We stayed here 1 night after a restless night's sleep in the Sahara. The room was basic but had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and I got a good night's sleep. The shower worked well but the sink was too shallow and drained somewhat slowly.  The view is great from the terrace. Aziz and his family were great hosts - always smiling and they quickly set a table for us in the courtyard when we complained about the smokers in the dining area. They also had musicians come and sing and play during dinner and beyond. Dinner and breakfast were good and plentiful. This was a nice stop on our 3-day journey from Fes to Morocco.,4.0
"We only stayed one night, unfortunately. We were a group of six in our way to the desert. It’s a family own hotel, in the middle of nowhere, but its well worth it. You are very well welcome, the food is very nice, and the quietness of this place, especially at night, in the terrace, under the stars, it is indescribable.

We'd had a fairly long drive via Telouet & Ait Benhaddou so arriving at Dar Panorama was a welcome end to a great day. The friendliness & hospitality from the Berber family that owned the hotel was great, from the welcoming mint tea as the sun set over the neighbouring hills, to the delicious tagine dinner we had later. The room was clean, spacious & the place was beautifully quiet - that night we were the only guests, and as the hotel was located on the edge of the oasis, no local traffic or noise. Breakfast next morning was freshly cooked pancakes, honey, jam &  coffee then we were farewelled by the team. A great, friendly place to stay.",5.0

Of all the places we stayed at in Morocco, it was probably our favourite and we wished we'd been able to stay there longer.  It is a small, family-run guesthouse with an incredibly warm welcome, gorgeous views and delicious food.  Everything seemed to work effortlessly and efficiently like clockwork.  There is a large terrace area with tables and soft chairs where you have the most beautiful views and sunsets.  Our room was large, very clean and had a huge en suite shower area too.

The best tagine we had eaten all holiday.The room we had was large, clean and comfortable with a good size shower room with hot water.  It has no pretensions of being luxury and all the better for it.   We stayed just one night on the way to the desert.  I would recommend this as a base for exploring this part of Morocco- for say 2/3 nights or just relaxing on the roof terrace enjoying the view over the oasis.",5.0

Much to our surprise the owner came by on his motorbike looking for us and showed us the way!  From there, it only got better. The grounds are beautiful and the food was top notch.  There is a lovely 180 degree view from the rooftop. The rooms are nice and quiet.  It truly is an oasis.  I hope to return and stay longer than just 1 night.  Highly recommend!",5.0
"Kasbah Dar Essalam is perfectly located, deep within the oasis and relatively far away from town, a dusty and uninspiring place. Arriving at the kasbah feels like entering the garden of Eden. The garden is amazingly beautiful. It has many places to retreat, enabling you to fully enjoy the large swimmingpool, fruittrees and flowers.

We arrived unannounced at 6am and although they didn't have a room at that point in time that let us stay for breakfast at a minimal cost and even offered us the use of showers. Luckily for us a room became available. It was fresh, airy and clean with great views. The grounds are peaceful and the gardens beautiful. They also booked our bus ticket and dropped us at the bus stop. Highly recommend stopping here for a night or two. ",5.0

Sitting on the patio a warm evening sipping mint tea enjoying the setting sun, you feel blessed. On the premise there is lots of nooks and crannies where you can sit and enjoy life.

It was like staying in a magical fairy-tale castle. The construction is from traditional mud and straw... you can see the straw in the walls. Even the stairs are exquisite.. Tadelakt with wooden lips. Our room was definitely not small (as others describe in their reviews here). The door opened onto a lounge area that had a single bed made up like a day-bed/couch, there were also a couple pouffes and a large coffee table, an arched doorway led to a bedroom that had cast-iron lattice-work windows in two walls. The bathroom was adequate and there was sufficient solar heated water for showers. Dinner and breakfast were served in pavilions in the large garden. Meals were plentiful, traditional and well-prepared. Also, mint tea and fresh dates when we arrived. The gardens are amazing! So many distinct areas and a wide range of plants. This is clearly a working garden, but is also very aesthetically pleasing. I loved that we visited during pomegranate and date season. Don't try dates straight from the tree! (they are extremely bitter until after they have been cured.) Exploring the various rooftops of the kasbah buildings was entertaining, so many great vantage points for sunset, sunrise and the gorgeous view in general.  Interior public spaces were also very inviting, but we didn't use them because it was perfect outside. We were here for a brief overnight, but this would be a great base for a few days, a wonderful relaxing place to just hang by the pool and read. If I could go back, I would in a heartbeat.…",5.0
"This is very beautiful place in the Palmeraie of Skoura. Unfortunately we had only one night there but we wished we couls stay some more days. The authentic Kasbah is lonvingly decorated and offers much space (patio, terasse and balcony) to relax. The rooms are small, but comfortable and cozy. Escpecially the green and well cultivated big garden with the pool is phantastic for relaxing after hot days in the beautiful area. We also enjoyed much the good service, Lahcine was very nice with us. Another big pro is the very, very good food, which can be enjoyed in the beautiful garden.",5.0
"This beautifully restored kasbah is a great place to relax. The gardens are being lovingly developed and the atmosphere is very friendly. The staff are all very helpful and attentive. At first we thought the bedroom was small for the price, but soon realised that there are many spaces, terraces and balconies to relax in. It was naturally a bit cold in March, but a fire was provided. Wifi was only available downstairs close to the office . Fantastic views of snow covered peaks above the palmery was a joy.",4.0
"Very nice place, the kasbah is an original one, restored and transformed to B&B less than 10 years ago. It gives you the perfect feeling of living in an oasis, surrounded by palm trees. There is an orchard around the house, and a small but clean pool, where you can rest in water after a hot and sandy day in the hammada, looking up to the night sky. The peacefulness of the place and the friendliness of the staff really made us wish to stay longer. I'd definitely advise this place to anybody passing through the Skoura oasis.",5.0
"My wife and I stayed here for a night, and wished we had stayed longer. I can't explain the hospitality they offer.

"On my 6-days trip in Southern Morocco, my 1-night stop in Kasbah Dar Essalam was a perfect choice. The host and his family are very nice and accommodating. The rooms are small but it is not a problem unless you plan to spend your whole day in the room... The pool is a great add-on during those hot days to relax and refresh yourself. The dinner and breakfast were awesome and typical Moroccan food. Make sure you have your breakfast on the outside terrasse, in the middle of the gardens.  Overall, an ideal location to stay if you want a quiet place on your journey or after visiting Ouarzazate.",5.0
"This place is a nice stop on the way to Merzouga. The swimming pool was perfectly clean, and peaceful. The kasbah has been restored by the owner's family, and though it's still beeing improved, it has a fascinating style. We stayed for one night only, and was enough since there's no much to do around the place, but it could be a nice place to relax a couple of days between big cities. Skoura (city) is awful, so don't expect more that what the kasbah can offer to you!",5.0
"If ever you need a break from Marocco's noises, smells and traffic, Dar Essalam is the place which will allow you to enjoy peace amidst a flowery garden, next to a cool pool or in its wonderfully decorated rooms. We highly recommend staying at Dar Essalam for longer than just one night. The oasis has got a lot of wonderful attractions to offer. Dar Essalam offers bike tours through the oasis which are highly recommendable and give a good insight into the local cultures and landscapes. The surrounding mountains are great for trekking or biking. Don't hesitate to ask the hosts at Dar Essalam for help when planning your trip, they are very attentive and helpful.

We have been to Morocco a few times, and this place is now one of our favorites.  We will definately be returning and highly recommend.   The kasbah is very friendly and the owner makes you feel most welcome.  Drinking mint tea on the terrace at sunset, taking in the stunning view of the palmeries all around you, is a memory that will last forever.  The kasbah is a really romantic place, and the stars are phonomenal. Great place for couples and families alike.

We stayed two days at the Kasbah Dar Essalam and found it a very welcoming and authentic kasbah with excellent food and staff who could not have been kinder or more hospitable. It is a little off the beaten track out of the village of Skoura but then this is part of its attraction. We took one evening meal there and wish we had taken two; the couscous was one of the best we had in a two-week holiday. Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the palmerie was also a treat. The Kasbah is an excellent base from which to visit the Skoura palmerie and further afield. Lack of alcohol was a slight disappointment but more than made up for by everything else.,5.0

Dar Essalem is a lovely restored Kasbah in a pleasant garden complete with swimming pool.The views are brilliant, the setting so peaceful.Though our room was not so big, it was exceptionally clean and more than adequate for our short stay.Our evening meal was one of the best we had in Morocco served up by obliging staff. The Kasbah is a good base for exploring the area......and ensure you visit Kasbah Ameril right in the middle of the palmerie and not too easy to find.",5.0
"Thanks to tripadvisor – otherwise we would not have found this place! A beautifully restored Kasbah right next to Skouras Palmerie and in the middle of many other more or less restored Kasbahs where you can stroll around. It is the pride of its owner (and rightfully so) who is determined to create one of the most beautiful gardens. The rooms are cosy, tastefully decorated and matrasses, pillows and blankets are just perfect! Also dinner is excellent! There is even a nice pool where we got tea in the afternoon – A perfect place to relax where we stayed longer than intended! For us it was one of the best places we stayed on our round the world trip – not cheap, but still affordable: highly recommended!",5.0
"We chose the Dar Essalam as a result of reading previous tripadvisor reviews, and whilst it could be considered by some to be a little remote, what a lovely place to stay it proved to be. The room we had was good basic clean accommodation, and represented fantastic value for money. Dinner on  the terrace was a memory that will linger for a long time, both in terms of the quality of the food, which was beautifully coooked authentic Moroccan, and the atmosphere and location. The place just oozes character, and whilst is still in some ways a work in progress, it is a charming and relaxing place to stay.The pool area is lovely, and gave us the opportunity to spend a very lazy day chilling and drinking mint tea. The owner is a lovely man, quite rightly immensely proud of what he is…",4.0
What a great place to relax. This is Real Morocco. We arrived after an all day drive for the Sahara at Merzouga. A delicious tajine dinner was waiting for us. (we had pre-ordered) Dar Essalam is a family run hotel. Everyone was very friendly and capable. The rooms were not huge but quite adequate and comfortable. The weather in May did not allow us to make use of the swimming pool. Had a great time.,5.0
"We booked this hotel online and had no idea it was a few kms out of the main centre of Skoura - we got a local to give us a ride for a few dirham. The manager was sweet and gave us a choice of two rooms - we chose the one furthest away from the mosque knowing that the first call to prayer at 4.30am would wake us up. We arrived late in the afternoon but still had time to enjoy tea on the verandah and the pool area. The property has so much potential if the gardens were filled in with plants and flowers it could easily compete with any 4-star property or safari lodge in southern Africa. For 10 Euros a head we had a lovely three-course dinner of salad and tagine (one of the better ones of the trip) and a wonderful chocolate cake for dessert. The rooms, while small, are cosy -…",4.0

"The owner of the kasbah comes from the area and returned in 2004. He has made a marvellous work in restoring the buildings and is now recreating the garden and surroundings. One of the servants speaks good English and is very helpfull - we had a 3 hours ride on mountainbikes through the oasis and visited the local pottery. Fun and interesting at the same time. We stayed 4 nights and visited the valley as well. We loved the Valley of the rose, 40 km east of Skoura.Go up the valley and hike or just take a walk along the river. The roses are not seen from the road, but grow as hedges along the fields. Blossom is in april/may - march is too early, but the valley is extremely green with beautiful scenery.

We slept all night on top of the bedding with just a blanket to cover us, we did not realise this until 8 am  Mmmmm ""idiots abroad"" comes to mind but saying that more bedding would have been nice.

We stayed 2 nights, as Skoura made a good base for exploring Dades Gorge, Ait Ben Haddou, Ouarzazate and beyond.  After tasting our first lunch there when we arrived, we decided it was not worth the effort trialling other eating establishments in Skoura so we ate breakfast lunch and dinner there for 3 days!

On arrival we had a drink in the herb and vegetable garden and stayed there until the sun went down. The Kasbah is very clean with simple Moroccan interiors run by a husband and wife team. We had a dip in the pool then a lovely dinner (choice of Tagine or Couscous) made with veg and herbs from the garden. He even found some beer for us with dinner. Also very exciting when he killed a scorpion running to the entrance.,5.0
"The Dar Lorkam is a nice small Kashba located in Skoura. It is an ideal starting point for travelling into the soth of Maroco as well as for going over the Atlas mountains to Marakesh. The Dar Lorkam has a nice atmosphere and one can imagin living in former times in Maroco. Dinner and breakfast is very nice although there are not many choices for different meals. The rooms are very nice and clean and provide enough space. The service is very familiar and good. There is plenty of parking space in front of the Dar Lorkam. The only problem is the way to the Kashba, therefore I advice to ask in the center of Skoura because the signs are not visible very well from the car.",5.0

We walked to the Gorges d'Agouti, around 13km, crossing the river several times. The rooms are basic, but comfortable, we had plenty of hot water and the showers worked well. Yes, the WiFI doesn't work in the rooms, but there was WIFI in the lounge. A pleasant place to stay in the area.",5.0
We loved our stay the Hotel Awayou. The staff was incredibly attentive and friendly.  Both dinner and breakfast were plentiful and very tasty.

"Stayed here as part of a tour.  First, let me say that the owners are a family and they were very, very nice and accommodating.  We enjoyed a tea preparation lesson from the patriarch of the family.  The breakfasts were delicious, and one lunch was served on one of the terraces.  I passed on the dinner but others in the group really enjoyed it.  The location is terrific, especially if you wish to hike the area, which is very beautiful.  Now to the less than stellar--the mattress was like a board.  The very thin sheet did not really fit.  Very poor quality towels.  The sink was not fastened down so it wobbled, and the toilet lid was not working properly, and the toilet wasn't fastened down either.  I never got hot water, except once for a few minutes in the sink and several others in the group also had this problem.  Wi fi worked in the very comfortable, pleasant lounge but not in the rooms.  I'm not sure what other options there are for staying in this area, but I would say that this place is what I would call very basic.…",3.0
"There is 'rustic' and then there is shoddy workmanship. Room 20 is a splendid example of the latter. I'm wondering if there is building code in Morocco because there were a couple of serious defects in my bathroom alone and they didn't look rustic either. Firstly the most worrying one was that the pedestal for the sink had not been concreted into place and wobbled alarmingly. Also some lazy person had drilled a hole as big as a fist as a home for the shower head but had changed his mind and placed the shower head below this spot. You or I would then have found some spackle and filled the hole - but not this chap. He has left it for prosterity.  There were also cracks in the bathroom wall but then this might have been a rustic look.  One of the taps in the wonky pedestal sink didn't work either. There was no soap and only a container of that pink detergent goo which is horrible to use but cheap for hoteliers. On the plus side the shower water was hot and I did have a very good shower. The curtains on the window in the bedroom were thin and did not stop the light coming in. The mattress did not have a cover and was just topped with a very flimsy and ill fitting bottom sheet. I found this disturbing as it brunched up in the night and I awoke to find myself lying directly on the mattress. I'm now wondering what skin disease I can expect. The building is in a constant state of expansion so it has a very rough look. The light outside my room was not turned on when I went to my room after dinner and I was unable to see where the stairs were. Someone with a mobile phone had to turn the torch on to show me the way. The owners are very canny and are aiming to make this into an enormous hotel over time. However might I suggest that instead of continual expansion for the sake of it, they pay more attention to the details that make a guest's stay more enjoyable? And sorry I forgot to mention the el cheapo bathroom towels. I have never seen these coloured towels outside my mother's bathroom. Every other hotel or riad in the world has white fluffy towels. That's what clients like. Although there is free wifi  don't think that they have enough bandwidth as when the hotel was full of people I could  never get on the Internet. In fact I was unable to log in for at least eighteen hours at one time. However when everyone went out I was able to get internet reception for two hours. Apart from the above, the hotel is in a prime location for exploration of the Magoun Valley and I'm not sure how much better the other hotels in the area are anyway!…",3.0

"Hotel Awayou had a few things going against it - the bed sheets were too small for the large hard mattress  so came away at the edge of the bed, ending up bunched up;  the bath towels thin with a brown tinge (pale blue as well as the yellow one), the shower sent water over the floor - over the small terracotta basin that is the drain area for the shower and soaked a non-slip rubber mat which became water logged and squelched when walked on. The lighting in the room was very low with one small light high above the bed and one wall light; and there were only two power points - one in the bathroom and one beside the bed. AC warming seemed ineffective, once the remote was retrieved from the hotel staff but there were the really heavy blankets as found in other hotels.  According to our tour itinerary this was supposed to be ""exclusive stay with a local family"" - really a hotel,  with other people staying as well as our Peregrine tour. Our tour group had dinner in the hotel and it was delicious.

Hotel is located in a picturesque valley about 15 km off the main road.

Small criticisms- sheets were a little small for the bed so essentially sleeping on the mattress (a very comfortable one though I must admit), the bathroom quite small and another towel or two would be great.

The building is a little hard to find which makes it feel even more authentic. The rooms and washing facilities are basic but adequate for the price. Meals were delicious and it is a relaxng haven from some of the more touristy places. Go there and and imerse yourself in a basic B&B.,3.0
"I spent three nights here but it was more out of inertia that I didn't move. The bed and bed linen were uncomfortable (and I've been staying in hostels for 3 months!), the shower barely gave a minute of hot water so I just chose to not shower or shower during the hottest part of the day, and no wifi. The food was good except for one night where it was inedible (Tajine with just bones, no meat). They charge if you take out the bike FYI. It's very quiet here. I was the only person one night before two families came. Not so great for a solo traveler. I spent most of my time biking or eating and hanging out at Maison Dhama where there was good wifi and a lovely patio. If I went back, I'd probably look into staying at Dhama.",3.0
"There are two buildings - the kasbah itself and the 'farm' or gite next door. In early February the kasbah was very dark, extremely cold with no heating, and very very basic rooms. We chose to stay in the farm next door which was marginally more cheerful. This is a newer building with 4+ bedrooms and one shared bathroom and toilet. It was all a bit grubby but we stayed for a couple of nights as we wanted to explore the palmerie. We were the only people in the whole place and according to the visitors book it was three weeks since their last guest.   The main difficulty we encountered was with the water. With the help of Mrs Slimani we managed to get 3 minutes of hot water squirted out of a headless shower and into a bucket. This then ran out when a second person wanted a wash and I was left wearing a towel facing a dribble of cold water. The water levels were low, and every time a loo was flushed or a tap was run the most appalling smell arose from the drains.   There are good things about this place: Mrs Slimani is a good cook and you will eat well here. The palmerie itself is a fascinating place to visit. The skies are dark and full of stars. In the summer the coolness of the kasbah is probably an advantage. Mr and Mrs Slimani are friendly and try hard to be obliging. However, this is an enterprise which really needs taking in hand and some serious investment if they are to compete with the many other alternative accommodations available in Skoura . For the price charged you can achieve a far greater level of comfort. After a couple of days we decamped to the Dar Dmana 10 mins walk away - padded chairs, a lovely room and our own bathroom for the same price!…",2.0

We stayed for a night on our way back from the overnight desert camp - it offers a decent resturant and has a bar which was great. The resturant serves buffet dinner and the people dont put which is which food - one of the guys didnt speak english and he thought all of the meat disches were chicken - he mentioned chicken to a pot that had beef - they need to know that much at least!

The service of the hotel staff was very good but the quality of the rooms left much to be desired. I wouldn't stay there again if I had a choice.

"I had very low expectations when I booked this hotel (based on pass reviews) but it was the only one in the city center with availability and responded to my late check in comment (we were arriving after midnight) and arranged for a taxi to meet us at the airport.  The hotel is dated and it shows (torn rugs, paint not the best) but it was clean and the shower had hot water.   Our room was huge (i think they upgraded us as it was the end of October and the hotel was pretty empty).  The pool was huge and decently clean, unfortunately it was a bit too cold to use it for more than a few minutes.  The location is nice, 10-15 min walk to the main square.  The breakfast could have been better. There was a large selection which was nice ( various breads and pancakes, eggs, meats and cheese). Unfortunately they only put out fresh stuff when item was almost finished. Since the breakfast started at 6.30, if u ate at 9.30 the stuff had been out for 3hrs. The second day was better and when new stuff came out we got it right away and it was warm and crispy.  The customer service was really great.

"Of the 6 hotels/riads we have stayed in during our trip to Morocco, this one is the most forgetable. From my observation, there are two parts to this place i.e. 1. hotel/motel 2. riad style rooms. We stayed at the first.   In Asia, it would fit the star rating of 2 stars.   The rooms are basic and clean. Nice clean hot shower. No design, decor whatever. Plain practical. The impression I got was that the cleaning lady took some drapes from her home and decorated the place.   The breakfast was average. The pool is average. The location is so so, depending on where you want to go. It is around the corner from the Kasbah but if you want to go to the night market etc, it is at least 20 minutes walk away.",3.0
"Ouarzazate is the home of the movie industry in Morocco and we were told that some internationally known movie stars stayed at this hotel in the recent past.  We were traveling with Overseas Adventure Travel (OAT) and were given an enormous 2 room, 2 and1/2 bath suite for our one night stay.  The rooms were arranged around a courtyard with lots of vegetation. The reception area was large and contained a small gift shop as well as a sitting area.  The rooms and bathrooms were clean and comfortable. The dining room served a buffet dinner with a large selection of salads, main dishes and desserts. Breakfast was substantial as well.",4.0
"My experience of staying at the Riad Salam could not have been more different to the previous reviewer's. Of course, we were lucky: my friend and I turned up unannounced at the hotel late afternoon, having checked out two other options in Ouarzazate, neither of which we deemed suitable. Without any prompting on our part, we were immediately offered a reduction of 50% on one of their suites, which made it very affordable (normally it would have cost 1,400 Moroccan Dirhams per night, exclusive of taxes and breakfast - around 83 pounds sterling per night). The suite was superb and had a lovely terrace overlooking the pool area. The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful and we found the location of the hotel excellent.  The only disappointment was the breakfast, which was in my…",5.0
"We stayed here last minute when our plans changed during travels through Morocco. Ouarzazate isn't a destination we were interested in and our night and morning there confrimed that. Riad Salam didn't make the experience any better.   The room was extremely smokey, the bathroom was dirty (hair, dust and stains), upholstery worn with cigarette holes and dingy, and one of the pillows on the bed had fresh lipstick on it. Slept in my sleeping bag I was so grossed out.   Worst breakfast we had in Morocco over 3 weeks. We paid equivalent of 70USD. ",1.0
"The Riad Salam is absolutely fine for a short stay - the pool is very nice (and very cold!).  The room we had was large; a bit old fashioned but it did the job.

"Spent 7 nights at the hotel. Lovely grounds,great pool and wonderful food.Avoid rooms above the restaurant area. During the day the ' Morocco in 7 days tours' were absent  so we had the hotel more or less to ourselves hence a relaxing quiet holiday.The groups would arrive early evening and be gone the next morning very early on. The town gets a bad press in the guides but we found it perfectly pleasant with wide roads some well kept buildings, pleasant restaurants and an intersting Kasbah. There is an excellent birdwatching area right behind the hotel especially in migration time.

"Booked one night here, ended up staying three nights. Nice hotel at the edge of town, restaurants and attractions on walking distance. The name of the hotel was a little confusing; google maps has the exact location, but the sign above the gate says “Riad salam”, staff couldn’t explain why. The hotel has everything you need, very friendly staff, swimming pools, a bar (they serve alcohol), restaurant, laundry service and so on. The place is a bit dated and the rooms are noisy, but it’s clean. I think it’s the best you can get in this price range. ",4.0
"We arrived not sure what to expect but we were given a lovely room with lots of space for us and the children. Unfortunately the food was terrible (think 1960s bad English buffet with tepid food and weird mixtures). No Moroccan food at all. Worst still, standards of hygiene must have been low as within 1.5 hours of eating I got a tummy bug, my 11 year old son was really ill the next day. We both ended up with terrible diarrhoea as we continued our journey. Only just recovering from it now back home. Such a shame as we ate in street markets and small cafes with no problems until here. Lovely venue, yes its faded glory but the room we had was lovely,  just do not have anything to eat here.  Feel sorry for the tour groups we saw. ",2.0
"This is a well located tourist hotel, only 10 minutes walk from the Kasbah and town centre.  And very reasonably priced.  The service on the whole was excellent (apart from the grumpy lady cooking the breakfast pancakes!). Our room in the older part of the hotel beyond the pool, set above a courtyard, was really lovely. Spacious, cool and loved the stain glass windows. Very clean with a fridge for our water. We joined in with the buffet dinner which was termendous value, and the salads were delicious. Felt slightly overwhelmed by 2 huge groups staying at the hotel the same night but we were allowed to sit in a separate part of the dining room from them which was good. However, they took over the whole pool area after dinner and there was not one seat to be had outside anywhere. Sadly this hotel is really let down by the pool area. Every cushion on every sun lounger and chair was split, faded or ripped - all in a really poor state of repair. Some of the sunbeds were broken too. The step ladder going into the pool was wobbly and felt like it was going to come off, and at 4pm in the afternoon the pool looked dirty and was the coldest pool of our whole trip. It's a shame as it looks nothing like the photos, but wouldn't take too much to upgrade it all a bit. Overall - this is okay for a quick stop over, the service was good, but the pool area was a let down.…",3.0

"This is a huge hotel and one suspects it is past its heyday.  There is a main block (Hotel Tichka) and also many rooms arranged in two storey blocks around courtyards.  (Riad Salam).  Between them is a large pool deck with bar, sun-loungers, fountains, etc.  We stayed in one of the courtyard rooms, overlooking the pool.  Room was very spacious, with two queen-sized beds.  All the amenities worked, with a particularly gushy shower and plenty of hot water.  However the bathroom was well overdue an update.  The hotel is a few minutes' walk from the centre of Ouarzazate and the CTM bus station, and also very handy for the Kasbah and the cinema museum.  We paid €30 including breakfast for two, so the faded decor and dodgy bathroom were more than outweighed by the low price.  One suspects in its heyday it would have been much busier and would have commanded much higher prices.  I quite liked staying in this almost deserted monument to another time.  Like being in a J G Ballard novel!  But the main thing for us was the practicality of the location before departing the following morning on the bus back to Marrakech.…",3.0

Had to confirm with the reception that we were at the right place.  There's no elevator available but we got a room on the ground floor.

"I stayed here for two nights, 29 and 30 December in room 227, which was quite a long walk from the reception area.  Hot water for the shower was available on the first night, but only lukewarm on the second night.  There was also no shower bracket on the wall so you had to hold the shower head when showering.  There were two single beds in the room and enough power points to be able to charge phones etc.  The TV wasn't working and the hotel staff member asked if I wanted to change rooms.  However, this was a two night stay on my KRAS 'Highlights of Morocco' tour and I had decided to unpack my suitcase this time.  My answer to him was that I didn't want to change rooms.  The remote location of this hotel made it difficult to reach the centre of town by foot although 'petit taxis' were available for a flat fare of MAD 5.00, something I took advantage of the following afternoon.  I can't write anything good about the food because it was the same bland offerings to which I had become accustomed at the previous hotels on my tour.  I was hoping this hotel would have been better because it was ranked as a 4*,  but it certainly fell short of my expectations.  One enjoyable aspect of my stay here was that on the Saturday nights both bars were very lively, one playing Arab music and the other Berber music.  It was a good opportunity to experience the authentic hospitality of both groups and ditch the tour group members with whom I was travelling.  I wasn't disappointed!  WiFi was available in the lobby and intermittently available in the room.  If I were visiting Ouarzazate again, I would stay at the Berber Palace Hotel, frequented  by actors and actresses shooting films here.

The diner was a nice buffet, not too much but more than enough for my likes. The biggest complaint actually was that the doors couldn't be closed quietly from the outside.

"We had a group booking here and the reception area made us feel good about the place. That soon changed when we went to our room and found it to be dark, quite threadbare, no fridge, TV not working, an odd odour and a grotty bathroom. The breakfast buffet was poor, with few options beyond bread, boiled eggs, olives and stale pastries. We had to ask for yoghurt to be brought out. Not nice, which is a shame, because I liked the town of Ouarzazete and the region.",2.0
Unfortunately we had found a place for our group only in this hotel  thanks God it was only for one night  The room was pretty dirty and the dining room also felt like dirty (for example the table cloths had stains) The food however was tasty although the selection was not too large. The only plus side is the swimming pool which was desert at 6 o clock in the afternoon so our kids had a lot of fun,2.0
The room had an old musty smell when we first walked in. The blankets and shower curtain looked worn out. The lock was broken and it took a while to open it using the key. Our room was the only one on our floor without a keycard lock. The WiFi only worked in the lobby and the food wasn’t very good. But the staff was friendly and helpful and the location was ideal for one night in Ourzazate. ,3.0
"Hotel Karam is not a palace  Service is not at the level of a standard hotel. Even if it seems to be improved year after year, ( I ve been there on 2016, 2017 and April 2019), the personnel is nice but not as expected. Rooms and bed are confortable, bathroom looks old and not functioning very well. Garden looks nice with flowers.  Buffet is poor and plenty of other better places for dinners in the city: jardin des Arômes is definitely the best place. Pool is enough big for good refreshing.  Enjoy your stay un Ouarzazate!

Staff is OK, food also. Not good enough for the price",3.0
"First hotel stop prior to engage in a one week Mountainbike challenge in Morocco, this hotel had very spacious outdoors with a nice swimming pool and live music in the evening. Due to its elevation, it also gives you a nice view of the Ouarzazate valley.  However, rooms were a bit more disappointing; they were quite small and average according to local standards. Our room gave access to a inside garden which was clearly not maintained (high grass, unmaintained trees and shrubs) but that didn't bother us. The outdoor pool featured a bar, but they problem was that it was sometimes hard to find a barkeeper; it seemed someone was present when they felt like it, but empty most of the time. Internet speeds are quite slow, so don't expect this to be the place to send your pictures to…",3.0

This hotel is normal Moroccan standard. It has a nice swimmingpool area. The rooms are ok with a nice bathroom. The only negative I can say is that the wifi was almost non existent - especially when there were a lot of people in the lobby.,4.0
"To be frank, this hotel seemed well equipped with many appealing facilities such as outdoor pool, pavilion, bar, terrace, etc. and looked nice in its appearance at my first glance, but I totally changed my impression upon my entry to my room which was really outdated and not clean enough. During my stay for one night there, there were so many ""unwelcome"" guests fooling around inside my room, including ants crawling on the ground and along the walls, spider hanging from the ceiling, and annoying mosquitoes and flies disturbing my sleep. In addition, my bathroom was not clean enough and many places became rusty that I only wanted to finish my shower and left the space as soon as possible. The next day I entered the restaurant at 8:30 a.m. to enjoy my breakfast but found all…",2.0

Cleanliness is not their strong side as well, ants and bugs in the bathroom. No Wifi in the rooms, and even in the lobby it is quite slow. Dinner and breakfast ordinary, with limited variety.",3.0
"Better to look for another hotel. Breakfast was poor, the milk was spoiled, there were no cheeses, the bread was not fresh Average dinner.  The waiter who treated us was not polite, accused us of ordering a bottle of water without paying (a bottle of water we brought) and after a long and unpleasant conversation with him he realized he made a mistake but he did not apologized. We got a medium sized room. when entering and exiting the bath you have to pay attention because the side is high and can fall",2.0
"The hotel ranks high on several websites but didn't quite feel so when we stayed there. The staff was helpful yes, but really insufficient. The breakfast spread needs a lot of work and there's nothing for vegetarians.  The pool and the warmth of the Chef, the gentleman at the reception and Mazda at the front-desk were probably only thing that gave you a smile. The rooms are of good size but not very luxurious. The bathroom size was good too but you gotta check if fixtures work fine.",3.0
This hotel was basic but clean and everything worked and the water was hot. The food was at best OK but there was very little choice and it was not very hot. Breakfast was continental. It was a bit of a maze to locate your room or find your way out. The bed was not very comfortable.,4.0
The entrance was impressive and so was the lobby and pool area. Our blankets looked like dirty army blankets and we quickly removed them. Hot water in the bathroom was not available in the morning. There was shortage of waiters in the dinning room tduring dinner and breakfast,2.0
"From the outside and the pool & grounds it promises a lot, but the rooms are sadly to say tiny and poorly kept.  The buffet in the restaurant also shows promise but lacks taste. On the bright side they have a fairly good bar with live music which was the best thing about this hotel.",2.0
We had a triple room which was depressing and dingy.  We had no water and were moved to another room at 9.30 pm. .This room had no hot water.  By 11 pm I was so fed up I chased maintenance  guy away.  There were no other guests in the the block we were put in and they could just have opened another room for us to use shower.  We all three had ice cold showers the next morning.  When I complained the next morning the receptionist was dismissive and said it was because we had a triple room.  Hope this hotel closes down soon,1.0
"The room sadly was very poor. With a double bed it was so small that you could hardly move in it. there was a desk / dressing table but the only way I could get to it was by pushing the bed to one side and I had to sit on it to write at the table. In addition there was no side light on the table The bathroom needs an upgrade but it was clean. The gardens, grounds and pool area were good. The food was also good and the staff very friendly",3.0

"I stayed at the Karam Palace for 3 nights last week during a business trip. I had previously stayed at the neighbouring Ibis Hotel and decided to change this time as the Ibis is rather quiet. The Karam Palace is certainly a busier hotel with a lot of tour groups staying there. The room I had was basic but fine. The bed was quite comfortable and there was plenty of hot water. The 'shower' head in the bath was pretty poor though. It is set (when placed on the wall fixing) at a near vertical angle, such that the already weak water pressure has no chance of reaching you unless you sit on the bath taps! Fortunately the water temperature is consistent so you can at least have a decent wash. The TV had only 3 channels (one German, one French and BBC World), which is okay for catching…",3.0
"This hotel from Ouarzazate is looking amazing! It is decorated in a traditional way but what I loved most is that the rooms are in separated buildings, each with gardens and lots of flowers. The rooms are just ok, not exceptional, but when you enter there you can say it that you are in Morocco. The bathroom is big and clean, I loved the ceramic there, but you can see it is an old building.  There is an outside pool - even in the middle of October, there were people swimming, on the edge of the pool there are lots of sunbeds and in the back of those sunbeds there are some hidden corners, decorated with colored pieces of ceramic and lots of pillows, where you can relax, drink a tea or a coffee. The food - the breakfast is average, not my favorite. But the dinner was super ok! Lot…",4.0

Overall property looks funky. Rooms were small & the mosaic in the room and bathroom was very cheesy. Not much facilities in the hotel room. No wifi was available in the room even though it was there in the lobby. The hotel could not give us two access cards for two people staying in the room which was odd. Both buffet breakfast & dinner was average with hardly any options for the vegetarians. ,3.0
We arrived to the hotel late night. The room was stinking of cigarette smoke. They agreed to change the room where the smell was better. The room needs an urgent upgrade. While it claims to be a 4★hotel I ll would not give it even 2★.  All the furniture is old the decoration is ancient the bothrooms are from another century and the dinner and breakfast were nothing to desire.  In two wards-BAD EXPIRIENCE,2.0
"This is one of the worst hotel we stayed in Morocco. There were lots of ants in our room and a big cockroach also in the next room. The room was so basic and small with uncomfortable bed and the pillow. The good thing was, we only stayed for one night and everyone was so happy and eager to get out of there early next morning. The buffet dinner was limited and breakfast was just continental.",2.0
"Keep in mind that there is not many hotels in this area so your choices are slim.  The hotel is clean, the staff is more than welcoming and hard working.  Their basic infrastructure just needed updating and I would rate this as a 3-4 star hotel but instead it rates much lower in my book.  We stayed here with our tour group of 34 people and each one of us had a problem of some sort.  Ours was that it took forever for the front door lock to work and I finally had to have it reset at the front desk.  The heating/air conditioning remote was confusing and we could not find instructions anywhere so I had to call maintenance to explain it to us.  It took a while for the poor maintenace man to make it to us since he had so many calls for assistance but he was pleasant and efficient.  We…",2.0

There was no safe in the room, and slow spotty wi-Fi.  The beds were very hard and very low to the floor.  The shower was very high to get into, I needed help from my husband to get in and out. The toilet bowl was dirty, and the TV was an old style one. The dinner was not interesting at all, breakfast was no more than a continental breakfast with some unidentifiable lunch meat.  I had cheese and a roll both mornings.  The wild cats walking around the dining room enjoyed the meat.  This was by far the worst hotel of our tour.",2.0
"My room was very small.  Service was 'just okay'.  The deal breaker for me was you had to BUY water at breakfast.  For me, this was a big deal.  All hotels on our Gate1 tour up to this point provided bottled water at breakfast.  They know we tourists can't tolerate their water but they don't provide potable (for us) WATER?  Very tacky in my opinion and not acceptable in a hotel that advertises itself as 4 star.  I cannot recommend this hotel at all.  Our tour guide apologized profusely for this hotel....even before we got there...saying it was not good but the best there was in Quarzazate.  Hmmmmmmmm.",3.0
"Correct address is Avenue Moulay Rachid BP 150, 45350.  Good bones.

Room temperature was set at about 90/ 30C upon arrival.  Air conditioning didn’t work so turned off HVAC altogether to cool down room.  Use the remote to control heat and be patient as it seems to take forever for fan to turn on or off. Large bathroom with plenty of space to place all your bathroom stuff.  There was a bathtub,  but there was no hot water on day one or day two, just warm, so I took a  shower which was better for water conservation anyway. Limited outlets.  Poor wifi.

I am not at all interested in being in contact or onlne while travelin - it is my escape from life, why mess it up with WiFi - but many on the trip lived for every stop where they could go back home through their devices.

Topping the list was the lack of hot water our first day, even at nine o'clock at night. The rooms had no safes, no refrigerators, and no lock on the small patio door leading to the back. No ice was available, even at the bar. Service at the buffet dinner could have been better. The dinner buffet was just OK the first night and breakfast was a tad more than a continental…",3.0

Our tour leader had earlier contacted the hotel to ask if they would be having a private New Year's Eve party (for the party animals in the group) and we paid extra for it, but it was excellent fun,  varied local entertainment, plus a trio with singer provided dance music: a great way to ring in the New Year.  The strong points for the average traveller are good food, good bar, nice hotel, but slightly rundown, WiFi in the lobby only, service was spotty, rooms okay, bathrooms okay, halls dark.  Bring a penlight.  Did not use the hammam or the pool (too cold outside). It was fine for two nights.

"We stayed here on our way to Erg Chigaga and were delighted with the setting and the accommodations. The owners, a retired French couple, welcomed us warmly and ensconced us in a lovely room with a view of both the rest of the Kasbah and the Valley of the Almonds. The bed was comfortable, and the shower was fine (and welcome). The owners are jazz aficionados and set up a Jazz Room as an alternate dining area, replete with pictures of jazz greats, and excellent jazz playing in the background. Dinner was first rate, and plentiful, with impeccable service. They have a lovely terrasse area to grab a drink before dinner and relax, listening to the evening winds softly ruffling the trees in the valley. If you have time, take a walk down to the river in the valley, where you will see…",5.0
"We spent 1 night at Kasbah Ellouze. I loved the views of the old fortress, nearby orchard and mountains.The owners and staff were very gracious.  The dinner we had in the cozy restaurant was some of the best food we had on our trip. We stayed in the family room which was very spacious. However, the room was dusty, bedding was old and uncomfortable and could definitely benefit from a makeover.",4.0
"We spent just one night at this lovely guest house, but we were charmed not only by the beautiful property but the warm and friendly owner and staff.  Our room was lovely with two bedrooms and a balcony that overlooked the guest house and the valley beyond.  The staff brought up mint tea right after we arrived so we could sit on our balcony and enjoy the beautiful view.  Dinner in the jazz room was very nice, as was breakfast on the terrace.  I especially enjoyed the homemade French yogurt mixed with some of the apricot preserves.  The location is really beautiful, although you need to have transportation to reach it.  It is not in town.  Shower was warm, beds were comfortable, and room was well-appointed.  We would stay here again.",5.0
Such a beautiful place run by an adorable french couple and local people that are smiling form their hearts!   The location is ideal to be used as a base for excursions to explore the area. Very close to the famous Ait Benhaddou without having to stay in this overly touristic place.  Food was exquisite - one of the best dinners we had in Morocco! In actual fact better than one we had in one of the fancy Marrakech restaurants.,4.0
"Although it was only for one night, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. From the start, the French couple that owns the place was very friendly and accommodating. The same can be said for the staff that works there as they were always smiling and willing to help any way they can. The Kasbah is located near a garden, where you can take a nice scenic walk until you reach a river, where I'm sure you can take many beautiful pictures. I also had dinner and breakfast here and they were delicious and plentiful on both occasions. I would definitely recommend this calm and quaint guest house!",5.0
"We booked through a tour company, and honestly, when we arrived I thought there had been a mistake. We stayed in a very nice Riad in Marrakech, and upon arriving to this place, I lost all confidence in their judgment. This is a basic place to be sure, and the fact that it is in a more remote area makes certain things understandable. Still, there is no real effort being expended here. The bedding and carpets in the rooms look old and dirty. My shower was broken (and being held up with a piece of wire - a repair probably cost 4 euros). The food is fine, and it is indeed ""calm"" (though I imagine this is true of everything in the area), but other than that I just don't understand it. There are perfectly nice Riads not that far from here (we also stayed at Kasbah Azul which is at…",1.0
This is a guest house in a kasbah. It really gives you a sense of what it would be like to live in one for it is part of a real kasbah. You get views of the kasbah from you room and there were sheep in the courtyard next door. Fascinating. It is hosted by a lovely French couple who LOVE jazz and opened it 16 years ago. The food is fine and the accommodations are fine but the whole place needs some refreshing after 16 years. A unique place that could use a little upgrading.,4.0
We only spent one night at Ellouze but we will certainly come again. Such an incredible structure and views from this amazing location and beautiful grounds and aesthetics created by the owners. The dinner was exceptional and the dining room was decorated with the collection of photographs of jazz greats with the music to go with it. Breakfast was lovingly made and we almost didn’t want to leave. I have stayed in many places in Morocco and I can tell you this place is unique. ,5.0

"The entry to Kasbah Ellouze was unlike anything we had experienced before. As you follow signs through dusty passageways to reach it, you may be forgiven for wondering if this is going to be one of those uh-oh places. But as one quickly learns in Morocco, it what is behind the door that counts, and once you enter the guest house, it is clear this is something special and, in our view, a remarkable value.   The owners and the entire staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. The rooms, grounds, decks and pool are all in pristine condition. Our rate included dinner and breakfast, and both were wonderful.  This was our first night in Morocco, and what a wonderful welcome it was to the country. Highly recommended. ",5.0
"We found Chez Colette and Michel by accident, and what a find it was.  The kasbah is tastefully refurbished in the Moroccan style, with a very homely, calm and peaceful ambience.  Surrounded by beautiful scenery and interesting walks, it sits proudly behind an almond tree orchard which leads down to the river bed, and is a short drive away from the World Heritage Site of Ait ben Hannou.  We had delicious meals both nights we were there, and the reasonably priced wine list was an extra treat!  Colette, Michel and all of the staff were most helpful in suggesting things to do and see, and very attentive to all our needs.  We will definitely return, hopefully to stay longer!",5.0

We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of October 2017. We were 2 adults and 2 kids. From the moment we arrived we felt really welcome and that we were not just yet another group of guests staying for a few nights. Colette and Michel have created a truly fantastic place - full of warmth and providing a really different experience from what you would expect in most hotels. The food was a great mix of traditional Moroccan food with some French influences and was consistently delicious. The staff working there were just great - good fun with the kids (particularly Mohammed!) and really helpful. We really appreciated Colette's input into helping us plan our trips out - always practical.  Particular highlight for us was the trip out on the 4 camels which was included in our stay and…,5.0

The owners and staff were very welcoming and made us the best meal we had in Morocco: pumpkin soup, turkey tanjine and an amazing dessert.  All food was prepared fresh in the small authentic kitchen.  Our room was very basic, but loved the minimalistic setup and 'country' feel.  The beds were comfortable and had a great night rest in the quiet surroundings.  One of my favorite part of the guesthouse was the jazz room, where we have relaxed after dinner and had a nice conversation with Colette.

"We spent one glorious night here on the way to the Chegaga dunes in the Sahara. The setting could not be more appealing -- in the midst of the red rock desert, bordering a grove of olive trees next to a lovely river. Mohamed escorted us on a magnificent walk through the trees and down to the river, then brought us back for a spectacular dinner. The next morning, our kids made bread with some women who live next door, watching the dough they kneaded deposited into a wood-burning clay oven. We all loved the revitalizing swim in the lovely pool after the long, hot drive. Our room was gorgeous -- plenty big enough for my wife, myself and our two kids. This was our favorite resting point in Morocco. Highly recommended.",5.0

I have to admit at first we were overwhelmed with the large welcome but after a short time we realized it was warm and sincere.   In the evening we ate dinner in the intimate dining salon with the walls lines with black and white photos of jazz legends and listening to smooth jazz.  The atmosphere was conducive to conversation with other guests and the evenings felt very exotic.  And the food was delicious. From the exterior, parts of the kasbah look ruined but that just adds to the charm  (the accommodation part has been completely restored).

Dinner was served at a low table in a room filled with pictures of jazz greats, with some nice jazz playing, and breakfast was the typical delicious Moroccan feast.",4.0

There was a pool but closed as it was still tail endof winter.  The dinner to die for.. The best tajine to date. My son still raves about it.

We used this place as a way to break up the drive between the Todra Gorge and Marrakesh, thinking we would wake up and head on our way, but the wonderful owners and staff, combined with the beautiful setting meant we decided to delay our departure to enjoy the relaxing atmosphere.  The food was excellent, the location and surrounding landscape was beautiful and the kasbah was relaxed while elegant.  A great spot to stay.",5.0
We stopped for a night --- very pleasant B&B run by a French couple who used to have a Jazz Club in France --- dinner was great & an after breakfast walk thru the adjacent olive orchards & massive crumbling mud casbah was one of our trip highlights.  If you order a martini they give you a choice of a gin/vermouth or a vermouth/gin martini depending on the desired strength.  And of course wonderful jazz playing in the dining room.,4.0

The hotel/kasbah is run by a very friendly French couple, Michel and Colette. The staff (sorry I forgot the name) is always attentive.

It had a French twist, so was a bit different from what we had been eating and was very good. The staff are extremely helpful, carrying bags up and down stairs, guiding us to dinner, and just being very friendly.   The rooms were good. The bathroom was a bit cozy, but the shower had hot water as well as great water pressure.   My favorite part of our stay was the outside patio/balcony area. There was a neat little outdoor nook that we hung out in at night. This kasbah also had a great view, nestled next to an older kasbah used in a few movies, we were told.",5.0

"On a recent visit to Morocco, my friends and I traveled from Marrakech to a nomad tent camp in the Sahara desert. About halfway through our drive, we came across Kasbah Ellouze and stayed for the night. The hosts are a delightful, extremely hospitable French couple who have lovingly spent many years updating the hotel and creating a place that make you feel totally at home, gently pampered and like you're living in history. The accommodations are cozy, rustic and charming and the staff is amazingly friendly, attentive and accommodating. We took a quick dip in the pool to freshen up after our dusty drive, then sat on comfy cushions on one of the open-air decks sipping wine and watching the sun set before dinner. I was up back out there before dawn to listen for the morning prayer…",5.0
"We stayed at Kasbah Ellouze for just one night, as part of a trip itinerary organised by Wild Morocco - stopping off there en route from Marrakesh to the Sahara Desert.    When you arrive, you feel like you are way out there in deep Moroccan country, yet it's actually not that far from the famed movie locations Ouarzazate and Ait Benhaddou.   As a nature lover, one of the first things I noticed was the immense White Stork nest on the ruined kasbah next to Kasbah Ellouze - but 'la cigogne' was not home, at the time (although there were plastic storks on the roof of the hotel next door!)    We were warmly welcomed by the owners and staff, who were all really nice.  The hotel itself was immaculate, with an outdoor pool and great terraces to lounge on.  It was really hot, so after a…",5.0
"This was our first hotel on a four-night desert tour and it got us off to a great start. Hot, dusty and tired from the trip over the Atlas mountains, we showered, jumped into the refreshing pool, and enjoyed  our aperitifs.  Dinner and breakfast were excellent, with French interpretations of Moroccan cuisine and good wines. The A/C was a bit temperamental, but we opened the windows to let in the cool night air and slept well.  The hotel has a stable of camels and a camel driver who doubles as a bellhop. We had a walk around the gardens to a small river. The French owners are jazz buffs, and we followed up dinner on the terrace with a relaxing few minutes in the jazz room.",4.0
"We were completely astonished to come across Tamdaght, near AIt Ben Haddou - just a small grouping of mud-coloured houses in a small village domianted by four majestic kasbahs, one ruined, overlooking the gardens by the river. This really felt like a visit to another world. Michel and Colette have created a magical environment, the kasbah is extremely comfortable and very well run, the staff were completely charming and the meals excellent. It was pretty hot, so we were glad to be able to spend the afternoon by the pool, and the early evenng strolling under the palms, olives and almond trees down to the river. We also enjoyed the walk along the river to the next village, to visit the communal granary. And the visit to the house of Lala Kabila to help her make bread was a…",5.0

The food was very good and with 130 DH for one person (starter, main an desert) reasonable.  Its a very beautiful Kashba, lovely renovated and a nice host.   Unfortunately the wifi does not work and the toilet was a bit stinky and the hot water need long time to come.  But overall a very good choice!",4.0
"This hotel is a little piece of luxury in the middle of a serene, rural landscape. It is somewhere you would not expect such a nice hotel to be situated and therefore is a tremendous surprise when you walk through the door. To add to this, the staff greet you with a warm smile, take care of your luggage and show you around. The staff could not be more kind and each do their job very well, caring to your every need. The facilities are great, everything you might look for: swimming pool, very nice rooms, comfy beds, tasty food, and also some high speed, and free WiFi. I definitely recommend this hotel and I can honestly say this is the best hotel I've ever been to. The highlight of my visit to Morocco.",5.0

It has incredible views, the friendliest staff, amazing food cooked from their homegrown garden, and pool/terrace that gets the most gentle breeze....it couldn't have been more amazing. It doesn't look like much when you are approaching but it really is a hidden gem. It was such a relaxing way to end our honeymoon.   Wifi was a little spotty....best if used in common areas  Rooms were spacious but the bathrooms were a little tight with weak water pressure  Incredible dining room (jazz room)  I still wish I would have taken a photo f their kitchen....so darling!

"After the big cities of Morocco, it was a pleasure to stay at Kasha Ellouze. It is a very comfortable place with attentive staff, However  its real beauty is that its location gives you a beautiful rural feel with great views down the river bed, starry  nights and solitude.  You can walk to the river through the gardens or lay by the pool and you are close to many amazing locations. Will stay here again because of the uniqueness of the property and we have to return to the antique store in the courtyard, we know there are more treasures there.",4.0

The restaurant is situated on a side terrace with spectacular views of the mountainside and a nice breeze.  The kasbah has several lounging areas to include a room with pictures of jazz greats hung on the wall and very comfortable couches.   The ""jazz"" room had a stereo and we listened to jazz music while relaxing with mint tea. Additionally there were other lounging areas on the second floor that allowed for more privacy if you are looking for a quieter area.

"Kasbah Ellouze was a stop over between the desert and Marrakech but I am truly sorry that we only spent one night there. It was so beautiful and so restful. We had an exquisite room with a terrace. We even got to take advantage of the swimming pool which was a luxury. Dinner was superb with jazz playing in the background. Then we took a drink up onto the common terrace and watched the stars. Breakfast was the best we had in all of Morocco. The room was clean, comfortable and well appointed. Take advantage of an opportunity to hike to the hills. The surrounding area is strikingly beautiful and our young guide was very knowledgable and very helpful. All the staff were wonderful.",5.0

Just a few miles north of Ait Benhaddou or, coming from the north, a few miles south of Telouet on made-up roads (most of the journey from N9 to here is on unmade-roads, however, so be warned!). Beautiful place by the river in a picturesque valley. Lovely terraces to sit out on, and a great swimming pool. Food was good too. Only quibble would be with the room which was fine, but below the standards of other places we stayed in. And check out the camel trip. Not a great route, but really good guide - and it's cheap!",5.0
"I loved this riad. The french couple who own it are delightful and the waiters really good fun. The riad is an amazing design and the food is delicious. The pool area is gorgeous and so are the views from all the terraces. The surrounding countryside is nice for walking as it has a river and small village. There is a shop closely run by the friendly Mohammed but bargain hard as he has treasure or is it junk? who cares its all gorgeous.  Omar the camel wrangler is also fabulous and his camels love him. This place is a jewel in the desert and a must place to chill out at for a few days. G & T on the terrace, it does not get any better than this. Book early as it is popular.",5.0

The various sitting areas around the hotel are relaxing and very pleasant, including the restaurant area, and dinner was fabulous - one of the best meals we had on our two week trip to morocco.

Kasbah looks interesting from the outside but guest rooms were very basic. Bed was slightly uncomfortable and bathroom was quite horrible with some nasty smell coming out of pipes. Swimming pool was dirty - no one in their right mind would swim in it. Management was not particularly helpful - maybe if you spoke French he'd be more approachable. Food was basic but good. Overall was ok for one night but we would not recommend it or want stay there again (also if we had to stay there more than one night we'd definitely look for something else and give terrible rating).,2.0

An hour and a half was perfect time to be on a camel, and it was interesting to see the old granary in the next village. The drive down the road from the N9 past telout was slow but incredible too, even if a bit hairy in our little 2 wheel drive rent a car.",5.0

The room we were in was perfect, as it had separate sleeping rooms for us and our young boys with a small common room in between.  The accommodations are a bit spartan (the bathroom in particular), but clean and comfortable.  The dinners were magnificent and were served in a warm and inviting room with excellent jazz music and photos of great musicians.  The breakfasts were delicious, too.

The hotel in itself is not luxurious, although significant effort has been made restoring the crumbling kasbah and creating charming common spaces; the jazz room, where we also had dinner, is super charming (and the dinner/service- delicious- also included in the price!).

"A loose translation for the word Kasbah is large home or castle and in Moroccan terms castle is the more apt for the Kasbah Ellouze, located near Ouarzazae in Ait Ben Haddou.  My husband and I arrived in the dark but even so could see the shape of the Kasbah emerging out of the surrounding townscape.  If you travel to Morocco you will understand so much better how surprising it is to come upon or into the guest house accommodations which are all invariably hidden behind nondescript doors or walls which when opened are always into a surprising world of order and beauty and extraordinarily gracious hospitality.

Walking toward the kasbah was like entering a film set.  The rooms are relatively basic, but with a lovely place you're unlikely to spend much time in your room anyways.

The Kasbah Ellouze is about a 10-15 minute drive out of central Ait Benhaddou which makes it even quieter and more relaxing. This is a great choice if you're planning to spend the night around Ait Benhaddou.,4.0
"After driving from Merzouga, around 400km, all we really needed was to relax and recharge.  Walking through the door we looked bedraggled and warn out after spending several hours on the road but that did not stop Colette giving us big welcome hugs; instantly putting a smile on our faces.  We were travelling with another couple who had been several times before and they were welcomed back as if they were family.  After being shown to our rooms we were met on the terrace with cool Mint Tea and pastries - lovely!  We stayed in the Aicha Room, one of the smaller but perfectly sized rooms overlooking the Oasis. we had plenty of light from the three windows and perfect views of not only the Oasis but the terrace as well.  Relaxation has to be the number one priority for anyone…",5.0
"I've reviewed here twice before, so won't repeat too much, but this was our 3rd visit (and certainly not our last!) to the delightful Kasbah Ellozue, and it was as fantastic as ever.  After a particularly long and stressful 9 hour drive from Merzouga, we were all feeling rather frazzled, but as soon as we stepped over the threshold of Kasbah Ellouze all our worries vanished. We were back at our favourite guest house in all the world (and we've seen a fair few).  Warm and welcoming staff, for whom nothing is too much trouble, divine food and such a glorious setting on the edge of the oasis. It really feels like coming home!  Huge thanks to Colette and Michel, the lovely Lahcen, Omar and all the staff at Ellouze, it is you who make this place so special!  We will be back.",5.0
"Definitely THE place to stay on your way into or back from the Sahara ...... unfortunately we only stayed for one night and with hindsight would have liked to stay for second to relax at the swimming-pool and to enjoy another superb evening meal. This family-run amazingly renovated Kazbah pays a lot of attention to detail and to a very cozy atmosphere. The surrounding landscape is spectacular and so is the interior decoration of the handful of available rooms. It is here that we enjoyed our best Moroccan dinner. Among the many delicious meals in Marocco this one could not be topped.  The French owners and their local staff are amazing and can not be praised enough for their unmatched hospitality. We are seriously thinking of going back again soon, only to stay there again! An…",5.0

"I came across this little oasis almost by accident, but I’ll certainly pay a second visit, as soon as I can. Entering the Kasbah is like entering a different universe, where time flows in an unconventional rhythm. Colette and Michel, the adorable couple, are, at the same time, guardians of the portal to this parallel universe and our link to the real world, when they feed us sumptuously or suggest activities in the surroundings. I strongly recommend you try the camel riding tour, accompanied by the charming Omar, and the early morning bread-making workshop, with the enchanting 4 sisters.  It’s definitely an unforgettable experience not to be missed. Thank you, Colette and Michel.",5.0
This place was recommended by our Sahara camp owner. The setting is excellent in a small kasbah nearby Ait Benhaddou. The French owners provide very personal service and looked after us perfectly for the one night stay. We had a suite and it would have easily held a family of 4-5. The room was basic but clean and great value for money. Breakfast and dinner included were both very good.,5.0
"Staying at Kasbah Ellouze was one of the highlights of our trip to Morocco.  Colette, Michel and the staff were amazing...  We felt so welcomed and the gluten-free meal they prepared for my husand and I was the best meal we had in Morocco.  We enjoyed a great swim in their pool before dinner and after a lovely dinner had a chance to sit in the Jazz room and listen to great music.  I wish we could have stayed their more nights.....",5.0
"A fantastic little Oasis Paradise retreat with lots to do in the surrounding area. There are only a few rooms, so service is very personal and all of the staff are lovely. The owner, Michelle, is very welcoming and always made sure that we had everything that we need.  The food is mostly traditional and very tasty, serviced on the dining terrace overlooking the oasis, or in the jazz lounge, which although odd in the location, is a great place to sit and relax. The signed photos (addressed to the owners) of all time Jazz greats on the walls creates a lovely atmosphere and adds a personal touch. Seating in the courtyard and two other lounges is also very comfortable with a great atmosphere.  The surroundings of ruined Kasbahs and a Berber village give a great taste of local life,…",5.0
"We reluctantly spent only one night in this charming guesthouse in the midst of the ruins of a kasbah and would love to return. The owner, Michel, is charming and welcoming. We had a beautiful room with decor and colours complementing the old kasbah. We had a most delicious dinner in the jazz room after sangria on the exquisite terrace. Sipping mint tea and swimming in the generous pool was a delight. We highly recommend this charming oasis",5.0
"One of the best meals we had on our Morocco trip was the exquisite chicken tajine with figs and vermicelli with fruit at Kasbah Ellouze. For good reason, since Michel was a French Chef for many years. This delicious food was accompanied by great jazz, collected during the years he and his lively wife Colette ran a jazz club in the south of France. In fact, one of the most surprising things about our stay there, was eating such a quintessential Moroccan meal in a dining room that was a shrine to legendary jazz artists. Kasbah Ellouze also has a refreshing swimming pool, wonderful outdoor seating areas for relaxing, and comfortable rooms. Nearby, if you want to take a short walk, is Monsieur Omar's antique Berber treasure chest. Kasbah Ellouze is an excellent for an overnight…",5.0

We had booked a standard room, however we were upgraded to a very big room with its own private terrace overlooking the Kasbah... wonderful view !  The pool was also very nice and refreshing, as well as the dinner and lunch and breakfast we had while we were there.  Overall, the Kasbah is nicely located, just about 5 minutes away by car from Ait Benhaddou.  Would definitely stay here again.",4.0

Excellent Food - Dinner started with a cold watermelon tomato soup.  They prepared a vegetarian meal for my daughter (eggplant and other vegetables), the best chicken tagine that we had on our entire trip (French fusion version), and a pasta with vegetable dish that was delicious.  Breakfast included home made yogurt and the lightest fluffiest Moroccan pancakes /  crepes.  They alsoserve alcohol.    Proprietors, Oliver and Colette, were friendly and gracious.

"My family and I stayed here one night after three weeks of travelling around Morocco. This place is really really really wonderful. The view is excellent, rooms are clean and staff helpful and friendly. But perhaps the very best thing about this place is the FOOD! After three weeks of harira, tagine and brochettes... we didn't think we could stomach any more Moroccan food and were somewhat disappointed to note that tagine was one tonight's menu. We quickly changed our mind after just one bite. This had to be the best tagine we had in Morocco. The starter and dessert were quite delicious as well. Another thing which we greatly appreciated was the personal attention from the owners who took the time to greet and chat with each guest. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking…",5.0
"After a somewhat hair raising drive from Marrakesh we were delighted to arrive at Kasbah Ellouze. It is difficult to known where to begin except to say that they do all things well.  There is free and fast wi Fi. The food is fantastic and at short notice, in fact, no notice they we able to provide a dinner for me which was superb. This is quite a mission as I am allergic to wheat and so many other things that are part of the normal diet in Morocco eg onions, garlic, beans etc I would thoroughly recommend a stay here  Just wanted to add that Colette and Michel the owners could not do enough for us. All the staff were outstanding",5.0
We arrived at the Kasbah Ellouze at the end of a very tiring days travel. As soon as we set foot in this magical property our tiredness and cares melted away. The owners were very friendly and their attention to detail and sense of style is apparent in the rooms and the food they serve. A wonderful place to stay - just wish we had visited for two or three days rather than the one night. Definitely on our list of places to return to.,5.0
"We don't really think you need a restaurant (a room costs over £100 per night) serving cordon bleu cuisine in the middle of nowhere.  This Kasbah would have escaped our review if we hadn't encountered scurrying insects - which were not dealt with to our satisfaction by the management (one roach had been left dead all day in the room until we returned in the evening, of course the room was then full of ants too). It was cleared almost ""dismissively"" by snatching up the dead beastie and spraying the area liberally with insecticide and leaving us to sweep it up. Then it's mate appeared in the shower.

Thanks to the owners and the team!",5.0
After a fascinating but hot journey from Marrakech our group of 10 on an art tour in the Atlas Mountains were delighted with our stay at this Kazbah.  Warmly welcomed by the owner and her staff with generous extras such as celebrating a birthday with no advanced warning.  What a bonus to have a swimming pool in the desert and to be able to step outside the Kazbah and wander freely - eg taking mint tea with 2 sisters from the village as they shared  bread making skills in their home as well as walking to the river beside donkeys and villagers  going about their daily routine.  We wanted to experience Morocco in comfort and without feeling like tourists.  Charming and memorable.,5.0

It was so lovely and relaxing to sit on one of the terraces, taking in the amazing views, cooling off in the little pool. The owners were very attentive and the food was lovely. We enjoyed a trek on their camels into the Berber village and down to the river - definitely worth doing.",5.0

The pool was a welcome relief after a dusty journey though would be a bit of a heat trap in the summer months. The owner, Colette, gives all guests very individual attention and we felt well looked after. I wished we had been able to stay longer and taken their camel ride out to the caves. We just had time for a swim , a sunset visit to Ait Ben Ahaddou and a tasty dinner then restful sleep.

The staff were very friendly although we felt the owner was a little despondent at times, albeit polite and courteous.  The meals here were amazing, although a bit pricey (salad 40 dirhams, bottle of wine 140 dirhams). Tamdakt is located about 5 min drive from Ben Haddou so it's useful for excursions.  Considering the price, our room and bathroom was pretty basic. I would have expected more for the price. Nonetheless the rest of the hotel was beautiful!    ",4.0

"This is an old Kasbah run by a lovely French couple and wonderful staff.  We stayed here during the Feb half term & were a family of 4 (2 adults & 2 kids aged 6 and 4).  It is definitely worth the drive from the main Marrakesh/Zagora road and spending more than one night here to soak up the atmosphere of the village life.  One night is not enough. Visit the old Kasbah next door, walk through the almonds trees/fields to the next village.  Hire the resident camels to visit the caves.  Our kids loved baking bread in the village bread oven with the neighbours.  Rooms are very traditional & we had a lovely family room which could sleep 2 adults & 3 kids.  Amazing food & cold beer!

It is a charming Kasbah with somewhat basic rooms but good food and service!   We booked the suite, though given that it was just my husband and I, we could have done with a regular room since the suite is better suited for families as it comes with two bedrooms, a sitting room and a bathroom. We wish the owners had told us about the difference between the suite and a regular room (the suite has two bedrooms and a regular room has one bedroom) when we were making a reservation.

We came in the height of summer, and spent most of our time around the pool. The food here is great - we had lots of tasty tagines and salads, served on the rooftop terrace. You do not get a choice in terms of what you eat, you just have to go with whatever is on the menu, which was fine with us! Collette was a great host and made us feel very welcome.

From here you can walk along the road and then the river bank to get to Ait Benhaddou. It was cold at night, but I have to say this is the quietest place I have ever been - at night, nothing stirs, not even any insect noise! This place has its own camels, so you can do a trip out along the river to look at caves and the nearby village. The food was amazing - I remember some tasty tagines, and some special noodles.

Like most Moroccan places to stay, the rooms are set round a courtyard where drinks are served in the evening before a really delicious meal is served in either the ""jazz room"" or the terrace.

"Kasbah Ellouze was just perfect. My husband and I stayed en route to the desert and again on our return trip. It's a great stop about halfway between the desert and Marrakech, and only three or four km from the UNESCO site of Ait Benhaddou. The setting of the Kasbah is incredible, just above a peaceful river oasis. The river bank is about a ten minute walk and is lovely. Camel and 4x4 treks into the mountains are also possible.   From any one of the three terraces (all at different levels), you can watch the sun set behind red cliffs as the people haul grain harvested from the fertile valley on their backs or by donkey up the steep steps of the Kasbah.   On our first night, we had a three-course meal that included a delicious tagine of beef and prunes. When we returned three…",5.0
"Stayed for 2 nights in April 2012, what a wonderful location, atmosphere and building. Wished we could have stayed longer (which is why we are returning later this year!). The bedrooms are rustic and quite adequate, although the bathroom could do with a little updating (we stayed in Brahim room, great garden views). Fantastic jazz lounge for the evenings and where dinner is served (the food is awesome, although perhaps a little too much, as we found everywhere in Morocco). The staff are very smiley and helpful, despite our dire lack of French, and Colette and Michel are always on hand to help with ideas for trips, walks, whatever you need. Would definitely recommned a stop here, so peaceful after the madness of Marrakech.",5.0
"We stayed for 3 nights in April, as our final destination in a one week trip to Morocco.  Although this was probably the least luxurious of the three places we stayed, I think we had the best overall experience of Morocco staying here.  We had the suite up in the tower and thought it was lovely - and perfect for our family of 4 (two kids aged 9 and 14).  The suite has an amazing view out the window and also a really nice little terrace.  The owners were really helpful and the staff warm and obliging.  We were very happy with the meals and thought the overall value of the room and meals to be very good.

"What can I say besides too bad we could only spend one night here. We would certainly have not minded to stay here longer. We had a very large room, actually more a suite. The whole hotel is themed as a traditional Kasbah and you feel like in ancient times but with lots of comfort. Also one huge plus: Lots of power outlets to recarge our Cameras, GPS, ipad, Laptop, iPhones, Blackberry etc. at the same time. In other hotels it drives me nuts just having 2 outlets at the most. The dinner was amazing with a great bottle of wine (what else do you expect, the owners are French :) They also have a pool but unfortuately the weather was not really wanting us to take a dip. The only drawback is that it is a little far from Ait Benhaddou itself, definately not walking distance. So you…",5.0
"We were 3 females who stayed at Kasbah Ellouze for two nights in April 2012, and we had a fantastic time. The style is rustic, but that doesn't mean dirty or shabby - everything was very clean (save for the flies which you get everywhere in Morocco and have to quickly get used to!). The setting is amazing overlooking a beautiful valley and the overall feel is exceptionally peaceful and relaxed, with just the noise of the birds to read your book to. There are lots of little nooks and crannies to sit and have a glass of wine and relax under the stars.

We didn't see the other rooms so maybe they were better.

We immediately felt much at home on that place.  After enjoying tea served with cookies, watching the birds and the beautiful view, we soon started for a walk in the beautiful surroundings with the almond trees blossoming.  Omar showed us the 4 dromedaries Charlie, Stan, Ella & Maryline. In the pleasant sitting and dining room we spent an unforgettable evening. The food was delicious and we enjoyed the red Moroccan wine suggested by Collette. We had to move on after a very good breakfast. This was our best overnight stay in…",5.0

We received a genuinely warm welcome from Collette and her team and enjoyed a delicious lunch on the terrace overlooking the beautifully green valley (the tagine was especially tasty). Ideally, we would have spent longer over lunch but we were running a bit behind schedule (so much packed in with the amazing Sun Trails tour) so we had to eat and go in an hour. You could easily spend a couple of hours or more enjoying a slow lunch and taking in the views... Definitely worth a visit if it's lunchtime and you are in the area.",4.0

The proprietress also set us up with a morning of baking bread with a local village woman, which was a wonderful cultural experience. The terrace here is lovely. The pool looks nice, too, although it was too cold for swimming while we were there. All the staff are so very nice and attentive.

The staff and owners were fantastic with him and he remembered them throughout our holiday. We would strongly recommend this Riad/Kasbah as an experience not to miss if you're passing by. You certainly wouldn't regret it. It is very close to Alt Ben Haddou and has a well known Kasbah just next door! Oh, and they have their own camels too!",5.0

There are a few areas that could have made our stay so much better! The shower didn't work properly at all, from freezing cold to boiling hot in seconds, the food was served quicker than at McDonald, we had 3 courses in under 30 minutes and we were clearly in the host's house which involve them talking loudly on Skype in the middle of the courtyard and settling their disagreement publicly.

We were motorbiking through the area, and this place was a haven for us when we returned at the end of a hard day riding.

This place is a bit away from the many other hotels Ait Ben Haddou and is probably most accessible if you arrive by car.  When we arrived, we found the walk itself from where our driver parked to the hotel entrance a short adventure.

There are comfortable rooms, a relaxing courtyard and a terrace overlooking the fields of almond trees and fruit trees – and a pool. The small staff can’t do enough to be of service. And the food – from breakfast to dinner – to the home made ice cream  as a mid-afternoon treat -- is superb. Collette and Michel also own four camels: Ella, Stan, Charlie and Maryliane.

While the area offers amazing opportunities to discover local traditions ( the Berber granaries, the local bread oven) as well as relaxing walks just around the gardens by the river, the Kasbah in itself offers all the comfort one needs with air conditioning in the rooms, hot water and heated pool. The pancakes over breakfast were a treat. There are so many things to do around, one can easily spend 3 or 4 days here. The hosts and the manager couldn't be more accommodating.

Do not miss their dinner, it was among the best dishes we have enjoyed during our entire Morocco trip. The next morning we were again on our way to the next destination.

A family of four could probably stay in the room.  We also had a nice view of a park from the room. - We stayed on a ""half board"" basis, meaning we got breakfast and dinner.  Both were very good, with standard Moroccan fare for dinner and standard French breakfast.   - The hotel has some great balconies to have a drink and see the views of a park, but you will not be able to see Ait Ben Haddou. - The owners are fabulous and very customer friendly.

The part we stayed has not much to do with the one presented on the internet site, but our guide informed us that he had made better experiences with this part, being cleaner than the other one.

When we arrived at Kasbah Ellouze we wondered where on earth we had arrived but this place turned out to be an oasis in every sense. Travelling down a dusty track towards a crumbling Kasbah was a little concerning until we entered the courtyard. This is not a place of convenience for mass tourists but a place of peace for independent travellers looking for a place of contrasts at every turn. You must have your own car and have plenty of cash to avoid the 30 minute drive to the nearest ATM but anyone arriving without this knowledge was clearly never prepared in the first place. The Kasbah is in a beautiful setting in the stony desert but is next to an emerald green almond grove and wheat fields.

Kasbah Ellouze at Tamdaght near the famous site of Ait Benhaddou is a wonderful place for a stop in this incredibly beautiful area near Ouarzazate. Do not expect there comfort or luxury as in a five stars Miami hotel! Here there are only a few small rooms in an old fascinating kasbah. Dinner and breakfast were simple but delightful (the owner is a French lady from the Cevennes area). Do not loose  a promenade in the light of the early morning in the countryside around the Tamdaght ancient kasbah: the views and the sense of peace reigning there are really magical!,5.0

The owners and the staff are very kind and helpful, food is very good and not too heavy, which is pleasant after a while in Morocco (know that feeling of kefta in my stomach at 2 AM ? You won't get it here). Rooms are nice but we found the bed a bit small. We also found it a bit on the expensive side, but we feel like that for almost all accommodation we have been to in Morocco.

Our reception was friendly, our room was clean and stylish and the communal rooms and terraces are really nice. Dinner and breakfast were fine but not the best we had had in Morocco. the lack of choice might be a problem for some people.

The kasbah itself (more of a smart guest house than a full-scale hotel) was delightful, distinctly stylish and very fairly priced. Multiple terraces, fine views, pleasant service, simple but comfortable bedrooms, beer & wine, decent food (but very little choice). We booked the Aicha and Brahim rooms, which have great views (not all rooms do). Colette, who speaks English, was away; co-owner Michel is amiable enough but you’ll get most out of him (and the smiley kasbah staff) by speaking some French.

I must admit that athouugh Kasbah Ellouze was probably the best available, it was less nice than we expected, although still good value considering it included dinner.  The room was a little spartan but OK, the water so hard as to make getting a lather nearly impossible (not a problem with the Kasbah, rather a regional problem), and the dinner average --- not the good cooking we had expected form prior reviews.   The major negative was at check in where we did not feel very welcome --- might be due to our poor French or the manager's limited english.

This is not a luxury hotel, it does not pretend to be, but it is good value and characterful.  We had two criticisms - and they were significant. Firstly the management, although cordial, was not particularly friendly.

A bit more pricey than other Kasbahs in the region but reasonable value.    Stayed in the Royal Suite , Elmenzeh,  which was perfect with the exception of other fellow guests on our 2nd night , who had the room directly above us , and were clumsy enough to knock over a few items and walk around in the early hours of the morning . Due to the building type , not much acoustic protection from your neighbour .   The pool was stunning , but unfortunately too cold to be used for any more than a few minutes.  Day temperature was 26C , maybe if it was hotter it would have been more tolerable.   The food was the best we ate in Skoura , but sadly not as good as other 4 star Moroccon establishments we stayed at elsewhere.  Service was excellent,  Ali , Anwar and Mohammed Ali were superb .   Other than the pool , not much to do with little children . We managed to see the animals next door which was a nice little treat and a a half day excursion to Kasbsh Amridi., highly recommended. They do offer lots of other excursions , but Skoura itself is very quiet.   The Internet was a bit erratic and they only take cash , which makes paying difficult as you can only withdraw 2000 Dirhams a day   Ksar Elkabbaba  is a very quiet oasis and well worth a visit if you stopping over on your journey to other destinations.

We stopped here on our way to Marrakech. We could not speak more highly of the hospitality and warmth of the staff during our stay. We had dinner at their restaurant which was exceptional in both quality of food and service. The only downside was that it was too cold to swim in their very inviting pool as it was set in oasis like surrounds. Highly recommended.,5.0
"We were only here for one night on our way to Merzouga from Marrakesh, but once we arrived we wished we could extend our stay for many days. It’s a beautiful property with friendly and helpful employees who will show you around and make you feel welcome. The spa looked wonderful (though we didn’t have any time to try it out). And the dinner was perfect with good wine and beautiful candlelight. Breakfast was equally good. This may just be my favorite place in my now two months away. I really do wish to be back one day!!",5.0
"The grounds for this property are pretty, but the accommodations are a total let down.  We were in an upgraded room but there were so many problems we couldn’t overlook them.  Our room smelled terrible upon entering (like mold and mildew).  I thought turning on the air conditioning might resolve that problem, but it took 3 separate employees to figure out how to get our AC to work.  Once it was one, the smell persisted.  Then, I realized the plumbing under the sink was leaking so there was always water on the floor in the bathroom.  We received one hand towel for 2 people (even after I asked for additional towels).  As I was leaving the room, I saw there were 4 or 5 nails sticking out of the door directly beside the door handle - very dangerous).  The food wasn’t good IMO.  It…",2.0
"We got the “Bridal Suite”  which was very nice, offering vastly more space than needed. The entire hotel is attractive, with a pleasant pool area if you want to use it. The staff is helpful and the restaurant offers candlelight and white tablecloths with decent food which was not, however, as good as the room. They have a set evening menu but are happy to alter it if you have had one tagine too many. Internet works and breakfast is the usual Moroccan fare.There is no TV which is not unusual in the country, regardless of classification.",5.0
"I stayed overnight and the location is truly an original and look more like someone’s estate then a hotel. The royal suite was large, comfortable and clean. I had dinner in my room, which was lovely and breakfast by the pool. The team is friendly and helpful. The one thing I would change is the bathroom. It’s narrow as it divided into su rooms and the bath is in a small space and taking a shower was a challenge as there is no shower curtain- I would eliminate some walls and make the bathroom more spacious ",4.0
"Not sure why, but I loved this place, probably b/c it is a perfect place to stay on the long trek from the Sahara to Merrakech. Skoura is an old oasis and this hotel is an oasis within an oasis. It is not a 5 star hotel, but it is very well appointed and creates a sense of quietude and relaxation. The staff is excellent, friendly and has personality. P.S. one of my regrets was not spending time to walk around Skoura on a market day.",5.0

"Our stay was just overnight, but the atmosphere here was enchanting, imagining how it was to live in a Kasbah back in the day. It looked like a real Kasbah with all their towering walls and palm trees everywhere. Even the decor is true to the origins of the days of the Kasbahs. The remnants of a very old kasbah is still on the grounds.   As we entered, we were immediately greeted by the very accommodating and friendly staff. We were given a tour around the Kasbah by Abdul, explaining everything about the place. We were then offered mint tea and cookies in the foyer.   Although the property was not large, the grounds were beautiful. There are different places to sit and relax in the garden, each one completely different than the other and all surrounding the lovely swimming pool.…",5.0
"We stayed at Ksar El Kabbaba in Skoura for two delightful nights. The major reason for my 5 star rating is the exceptional service by the incredibly friendly and accommodating staff. The property is very well managed.   My room was really nice, quite spacious and very clean. High ceilings, comfortable bed and nice big bathroom.   We celebrated a birthday one night at dinnertime. We were entertained by the staff/local musicians and they made her a beautiful cake. Our birthday girl danced with the staff. The second night for dinner we were entertained again before and during dinner. It was so much fun. Our dinners both nights were very good.   Breakfast everyday was plentiful and very good.

We were very pleasantly surprised as it was like an oasis at the end of the road. We were greeted at the entrance by the staff, taken for a tour of the hotel and gardens and then enjoyed a welcome tea and cookies. The hotel is great, very well looked after, clean, spacious and traditionally decorated. There is a great outdoor area with a large pool and lots of comfortable and relaxing seating options to relax.

This place is just simply marvelous.  I could not see stopping anywhere else between Marrakesh and the Sahara. I was stunned when I entered and saw the lush gardens and pool. My wife enjoyed the spa treatment and it was reasonably priced. The food was excellent if maybe a little pricey. We bought the room as part of a larger tour so I'm not sure what that cost but it was worth it.,5.0
We had the most amazing time at this beautiful hotel and spa in Skoura. We made a new friend Ali who made our stay unforgettable. We can't wait to return. The rooms were beautifully decorated and the food was delicious. Such beautiful hospitality.,5.0
"Unfortunately the manager was not nice and the service wasn't good. I spent one night and it was the worst of my 4 day trip to the desert. They were not welcoming and treated our Moroccan driver with little respect, so I didn't expect they would better to myself and partner, indeed they left us waiting  around for a long time as our room wasn't ready and we dismissive/ ignored us when we asked when it would be. This was surprising as everywhere else we had stayed was warm, welcoming and very hospitable. Other than this place we had a fantastic time in Morocco.",1.0

We spent a wonderful two nights here and really utilized their services that included the: Hamman, pool, cooking class, along with excellent meals.  They serve alcohol and have a nice wine selection. The service was fantastic; Mohamed took really good care of us and from serving us cocktails at the pool, to serving us at dinner, taking us shopping for our cooking class ingredients, to judging our cooking contest and even joined us for a special star gazing evening in the clear desert sky!

It was only a stop over but wish we had another day to relax around the Ksar and hit the very nice spa.",5.0

If only we could have stayed longer (although I'm not sure what there is to do in the area). We were upgraded from a junior suite to a royal suite and it was absolutely gorgeous. The staff were very warm and friendly. The gardens are just beautiful. Normally they set up dinner at various small tables throughout the gardens, but the night we were there the weather was not good so we ate in the dining room. Dinner was delicious. I also had a wonderful massage in the spa.",5.0
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night as part of a desert trip arranged by Desert Luxury Camp.  The hotel is beautiful.  It has a really pretty pool and a nice spa.  We were given a tour when we checked in around 5:00 and the host showed us the spa and told us we could book things for that evening.  We were tired and dusty from the trip and decided to book a hamman for the two of us – we are SO glad we did because it was incredible.  I had had a hamman once before, but my husband had not.  We were scrubbed and massaged and lotioned by two women for 30 minutes.  We LOVED it and they were great.  I can’t remember what we paid for the spa, but I remember thinking it was very inexpensive.  The place is small, so dinner menu options were limited, but the food was GREAT:…",5.0

Wow, what a surprise through the gates of this amazing hotel.  Great staff, beautiful grounds and pool, spa and a huge perfect room.  Roses, flowers and fruit trees were everywhere.  We had a great dinner in the dining room with white glove service.  A really great hotel and experience!  We only wish we could have stayed more that 1 night as this was truly an exceptional hotel.",5.0
"Lets start with the bad: this hotel is mostly an overnight hotel (as it's halfway between the desert and Marrakech), although it deserves a lot more of its visitors time. And by lot I mean at least one full day, maybe two.   The city surrounding El Kabbaba has nothing for tourists, so best to ignore it and continue to the Ksar. Within the boundaries of its walls you will find yourself in a real oasis, lets name some of its features:  * Beautiful landscaped gardens (they have 4 or 5 full time gardeners) * Clean and up-to-date rooms including all amenities you need (no TV though, but who cares!) * Great food with attention to detail, not the usual 'tour group' food you get along these trails * Attentive staff that goes all the way to present a great experience  We came with three…",5.0

It stuns you the moment you arrive and are faced with a building of such sublime beauty. Then you are courteously shown around and it only gets better. It is a work of art, a huge credit to the people who have renovated it and currently look after it and manage it. It needs to be seen and experienced to be believed. I love Moroccan architecture, art and culture, this building is one of the finest examples one could wished for. Furthermore it has all the modern luxuries you could possibly expect including a stunning swimming pool in the middle of enchanting garden.

"After having visited so many ksar and kasbahs, it was such a wonderful surprise to be able to stay in one!  The original much much older kasbah (looks almost in ruins but still standing) is just next to the property, almost connected but the wall separates it.   The hotel is still family owned which makes it even more special.  I am jet lagged right now and really have no more words---but I would LOVE to go back to this place again when it's warmer---so we can use the fabulous pool, but not too warm so we can use the outdoor seating area---their gardens are immaculate and charming seating spots all around.

Every view inside and outside the Ksar is perfect and, in some cases, breathtaking. We particularly appreciated the walking tour that one of the excellent staff people led us on in the morning.

The rooms are exotic and differ from each other by theme/color etc. Night can get very cold indoors and out, and they tend to heat with outdoor heaters that suck O2 out of the air, so watch out. The restaurant serves standard Moroccan fare (tajines, pastillas, kebabs). Avoid the belly dancer (not a Moroccan tradition - pure tourism). The spa is set off in the garden.

"A very large hotel that was one very grand, but now seems to be survive on tour groups like the one I'm on. The place has lots of charm and character but the rooms are tired and old. It was clean but overall the experience is average. It's fine as long you don't expect to much.",3.0
"This is a huge hotel with expansive grounds. The gardens were well tended with very healthy roses underplanted with broad beans. The room we had was very basic albeit with a beautiful wedding blanket spread. Our water only got to luke warm and the shower base was very open making for a slippery floor.  Meals were adequate, but breakfast foods were slow coming out with eggs appearing when we had finished eating. Pool area was huge and I am sure when the weather improved would have been well used.Dining room staff were very friendly and helpful. ",3.0
"Interesting rooms with coffers for wardrobe and walls made from earth (or at least that's what it looks like). Looks great! It has a few decorated halls and a big restaurant but the catch for us was finding a disco-bar nearby. Cold beer and everything :D  On the down side, the rooms were a bit cold in November and there was no heating. #afkdeweekend",4.0
"I was traveling solo and with a pre-paid tour. They wanted to make me sleep in a room with a man I'd never met before unless I paid extra. This place is a horrible trap. The building looks renovated from the outside, but the inside is mostly empty, has sagging beds, the light bulbs don't always function, and the wifi is only available in the lounge. I attempted to sit in the lounge to use this, but the people at the front desk felt entitled to watch loud game shows on TV while I tried to work.",1.0

"We stayed here for one night ( with a group of 9 persons) Location is very peaceful and Far away from it centre of Kalaat M'Gouna. Services delivered by the staff was all that good because we only saw three people as staff.These people very polite. Rooms are little  and decorated in the Berber style included satellite TV, air conditioner and almost all the things to make one feel homely. Diner was terrible (there was only one water and I think he was also the cook) . Breakfast served was little and not to much choise... Swimming pool was big  but not clean.",2.0
"Hi, We spent one night with our motorhome in the camping in june 2013. There was no light at all and we were the only ones, and the camping area was not closed nor safe. We then went to the parking area of the hotel.  The showers were not clean at all and not maintained (mirror and sink broken): a total disapointment! However, the swimming pool is nice. In regards with the hotel, we do not have any opinion as we did not tested it.  But the welcoming at reception was nice.",2.0
"I visited this hotel in May 2010, during the festival of roses, but didn't stay there, because it was to far from the centre of Kelaat M'gouna. There are taxi's from Kelaat Mgouna to the hotel, but during the festival they take advantage and ask high prices.   Hotel staff seemed very friendly.   Big swimming pool, but don't think it is warmed and didn't seem very clean neither. No chairs at the swimming pool. Seemed a bit deserted.",3.0
La kasbah è da fuori molto bella immersa in un frutteto. Peccato che siamo capitati in in momento di lavori in corso e pertanto non è stato possibile apprezzarla del tutto.

"Came looking for a cheap room: found it. Had electrical socket in room. Sink in room leaked. Squat toilets in hall. Shower was fine. Staff were friendly. One mistake: Unfortunately I made the mistake of telling a tout where I was staying, and the front desk told him what room I was in. I did not appreciate the late-night knock looking to push a disorganized desert trip down my throat.  Location by the bus station is excellent. A moderate walk to the central square, or a local bus ride one way to the kasbah, and the other to the movie studios.",4.0
"Es un hotel familiar enfrete de la gare Rotiere, y a menos de 100 metros de la oficina de Supratours. Cómodo , buen desayuno en el restaurant de abajo, huevos, pan mermelada jugo. La habitación fue con ducha muy cómoda. Ya que las duchas comunes no eran demasiado atractivas.  Recomendable!!",3.0
"The location is goodish - right next to the bus/grand taxi/petit taxi station and roughly equidistant from Ouarzazate's main points of interest, the Kasbah Taourirt and the film studios. I'd booked with booking.com and was greeted on arrival by bus by a guy who knew all about me. I assumed was a hotel employee but who turned out to be a tout for a tour company and stuck to me like glue every chance he got for the first day or so. Slightly annoying but this is Morocco. The bathroom was a squat toilet and inadequate shower head in a curtained-off corner of the room, OK for solo travellers but not very romantic. The (included) breakfast centred on an omelette, stone cold both mornings. The water was never heated. The free wi-fi never worked once, in the room or the lobby. After the second day I shifted to the Hôtel Baba next door across the alleyway, which turned out better (more spacious room, proper bathroom with hot water).…",2.0

"Die Lage ist zwar sehr praktisch, da direkt am Busbahnhof gelegen, aber das Viertel ansich ist sehr unschön. Wegen des Busbahnhofs ist es auch ziemlich laut, auch früh morgens schon, da die Busse in einer Tour hupen. Von außen erkennt man das Al Waha nicht als Ho(s)tel, hat teilweise vergitterte Fenster. Die Angestellten sprechen kaum Englisch und auch das Französisch lässt zu Wünschen übrig. Sie geben sich aber die größte Mühe und wenn es mit der Verständigung mal geklappt hat, übersetzen sie es auch ins Arabische und geben bspw. dem Taxifahrer Anweisungen im eigenen Auftrag.  Die Zimmer sind (für diese Preiskategorie) von der Größe her absolut okay, haben eine Klimaanlage (!) und ein (übelriechendes) Minibad mit Dusche, WC und Waschbecken.   Die Nacht kostet lediglich 8Euro, ist also ganz in Ordnung wenn man nur mal einen richtigen Schlafplatz sucht und keinen Wert auf Luxus und Schnickschnack legt.  Bei dem Preis kann man wirklich nichts sagen.…",3.0
"Leider wurden unsere Erwartungen dadurch getrübt, dass wir kein eigenes Fahrzeug hatten. Das Hotel Noramed liegt ca. 15-20 Autominuten vom Dorf Skoura entfernt. Von der Bushaltestelle, in Skoura, wurden wir von den Besitzern abgeholt. Ein erstes Problem bestand in der Kommunikation: Unser Bus hatte aufgrund einer Panne mehrere Stunden Verspätung, was wir dann aber zum Teil wegen mangelnder Frz. Kenntnisse und zum Teil wegen der schlechten Handyverbindung nicht vermitteln konnten. Zu allem Überfluss streikte dann am anderen Morgen auch noch das Auto der Familie, okay wir sind dann irgendwann in Skoura wieder angekommen, hatten unseren Bus verpasst und durften einige Stunden in dem eher langweiligen, staubigen Dorf auf den nächsten Bus warten.  Ein weiterer Wermutstropfen am Abend unseres Aufenthalts war, dass in unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft vom Hotel jemand ein Feuer geschürt hatte was verdächtig übel nach Plastik roch und darüber hinaus war es nachts bitter kalt (in Marokko haben Häuser keine Heizung!).         Unser Fazit: Am besten ein Mietauto und wenn mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln, dann 2 Nächte buchen, weil die Zeit sonst mit Abholen / Wegbringen echt knapp ist. Ach so, die Oase ist wirklich sehenswert, aber man ist auch weit ab vom Geschehen, es gibt kein Cafe oder Einkaufsmöglichkeiten.…",3.0

Sehr gutes und reichhaltiges Frühstück, üppiges Abendessen.Wir fühlten uns sofort wie zu Hause. Swimmingpool wird derzeit gebaut.

"We only stayed here by accident as we were unable to get to the hotel we had planned to stay the night in, but we were given an excellent welcome and basic, but homely, food.

What a simply beautiful place to stay - every detail has been thought about and the result is a beautifully comfortable environment - inside as well as the grounds.  We only had one night but would love to come back.  We had a wonderful dinner and breakfast.  Just great!,5.0
"There were six of us who stayed here and we all LOVED it. It was the perfect oasis after a long day of van travel from Marrakech. The grounds are a rich oasis of palm trees, flowers, a vegetable garden, grass and other greenery which instantly helps you unwind and relax. There are numerous great sitting and lounging areas to enjoy, as well as a few animals who you can feed and visit. We enjoyed lounging and swimming. The two dinners and lunch where delicious and they were able to accommodate my daughter with Celiac Disease. They also very generously made me a delicious birthday cake since I celebrated my birthday during our stay. The rooms were clean and nicely appointed. Book early if you want to stay here as it's small. Vanessa for patient with all our questions. She arranged a driver for us from Marrakech to L'Ma and L'Ma to the Sahara Desert. While she told us he was just a driver not a guide, he knew good stops along the way and we appreciated that. Vanessa also arranged lunch for us in a small village with a local family. We ate in their ""dining room"" with the husband serving us the delicious meal his wife and daughter cooked. Their Moroccan omelet was the best we had during the trip. Vanessa was also helpful with our itinerary as I was planning too much, unaware of how long some of the drives were. We'd highly recommend a stay here.…",5.0
Beware very hard to find especially after sunset. However the property itself is lovely. You really need to spend 2-3 nights to take advantage of what is offered. We arrived late due to difficulty finding property signage is only lit up by your headlights. Had a lovely dinner and then straight to bed. Some issues with electrical outlets- my travel CPAP kept shutting down and you can not have phone and watch plugged in at same time. Lovely gardens to explore when you have more than 12 hours! ,4.0
"As the owner of an all female travel event company, where we sleep is always the most important consideration.  Vanessa has created one of the most magical and beautifully decorated spaces.  We actually had to cancel one of our excursions because no one wanted to leave the resort.  Additionally, the service could not be more top notch.  They thoughtfully remember who is vegan, gluten free, and all other needs of their guests.  Skoura is a precious place ... be sure to engage in the local experiences (i.e. tourist free) that L'ma will arrange for you.  I would book this hotel again in a heart beat!!!",5.0
"We knew the minute we arrived that we had chosen the most wonderful accommodation, located in a garden oasis! Upon arrival we received the warmest welcome and our entire 2 days were filled with awe and joy to be in such a very special setting. Vanessa and Xavier are the most delightful “hands on” hosts. Everything from the beautiful immaculate suites, the gorgeous exotic gardens, the heated swimming pool and delicious breakfasts and dinners were absolutely exceptional. It was extremely difficult to leave this special oasis, especially our new friends, Souvane, Abdelrani and Hakim. We highly recommend staying at least 3 nights! Thanks again for a wonderful experience❤️❤️",5.0
"Truly a welcoming, friendly, relaxing, and comforting stop after a long day travelling. Arriving late I wasn’t hurried and had time chill in the beautiful pool before dinner in the garden on a balmy evening. In the duplex the spacious downstairs bathroom and dressing room were well appointed and the upstairs bedroom was therefore uncluttered, which, with the good quality bedding, made for a peaceful and comfortable night. Sadly I didn’t have time to linger the following day. This is definitely the place for some downtime while travelling in Morocco!",5.0
"We are on 15 days trip in Morocco, stayed for 2 nights in Skoura at L’ma Lodge which turned out to be a total surprise. We have loved every moment of it and are sad to be leaving tomorrow.

If you plan to be in the area, you have to stay here! We are in owe and forever grateful for the memories.",5.0
"Where can you even begin? An absolute garden Oasis. A beautiful seven room boutique hotel in a Palm Grove in the middle of nowhere. We can't even begin to tell you how amazing Vanessa and the entire staff at L'Ma were.   The food was over the top, the pool was perfect, and anywhere we decided we wanted to sit, lay, or swinging a hammock was at our disposal.  Walking through the beautiful gardens was the perfectly relaxing stay we needed in our journey between Marrakech and the desert.  It was like sleeping in an art museum in our own personal Garden of Eden.",5.0
"Vanessa & Xavier have created an unbelievable place to relax in the middle of nowhere in SKOURA! I, along with my family, spent a night there & felt that it was too short a stay! The hospitality shown by them & their staff was impeccable! The property is absolutely stunning & the decor, including the landscape is something to admire! Apart from creating & maintaining this place, they also rescue non-human lives and take care of their well-being! We would definitely go back there, hopefully in the near future & spend some more time!  FIVE STARS ARE AN UNDERSTATEMENT! I wish I could rate them higher!  Thank you Vanessa & Xavier for welcoming us & all that you do! Keep up the good work. I will make a conscious effort to come back, with additional family & friends, and spend more than a night!…",5.0
"We arrived early for a 1 night stay, and were so pleased we did... In the middle of the Palmeraie, the L'Mar lodge has a French Colonial feel, the influence of the owners.  Vanessa is friendly and attentive, and the staff were great fun and always helpful. The substantial walled gardens are beautifully laid out with lots of hidden rest areas, lounging on cushions, with a lovely pool.  The food was excellent and our room spacious and the A/C worked a treat on a hot day!  We'd highly recommend and wush we could have stayed a 2nd night.",5.0
"From when I spoke to the owner Vanessa on the phone, I knew we’d be taken care of.  L’ma Lodge has the understated elegance I was looking for to relax and unwind. They greet you like family the moment you arrive. Their design feels organic providing private spaces for all guests. Lunch on arrival was delicious with fresh ingredients. The massage I had was truly relaxing and healing. Such a magical moment. The rooms are beautiful, unique, clean and quiet. The pool area was beautiful with all the facilities you could want. Even unique wide brimmed hats to shade your head. I would recommend staying here 100%. If I return to Morocco, I will definitely stay here again. Thank you Vanessa, Xavier and all the L’ma Lodge family. x",5.0

We highly recommend.",5.0
Great place tucked in the heart of a palm grove. Tastefully done. The staff was very kind and courteous.

Highly recommended.,5.0
"My husband and I stayed at L'Ma Lodge for four nights last month. Our hosts there arranged a wonderful drive from Marrakesh, which turned into a fantastic sightseeing trip all on its own. At the lodge itself, Sufjian took such good care of us! He arranged two tours for us, and when it was time to leave, he personally put us on a bus and then called us to make sure we arrived safely. The property is lovely, the food was very good, and the rest of the staff, including Abdi, were all great and made us feel like family.",5.0

"I have been to many resorts around the world & I can definitely say that this place is more than just a resort. It’s a huge hug & a kind of family for the visitors, located in Skoura. Skoura is an incredible palm trees village in Morocco. You have to visit it either during your stay in Ouarzazate or on your way towards the desert. L’ma Lodge thank you so much for your great hospitality! The resort is excellent in everything! Every corner of the resort is a little gem! So many different spots to enjoy, amazing decoration, cleanliness, service, food! All was a unique experience which is value for money for sure!  If you travel to Morocco, I strongly recommend spending a bit of your time visiting Skoura & L’ma Lodge.  Regards, Elena",5.0
"Sadly, I only spent one night at L'ma Lodge! It is a beautiful property with very attentive staff. My only small complaint is the lack of wifi in the rooms, which forces you to go to the shared spaces to send an email, etc. Aside from this, it could not have been a better stay.",5.0
"We just had a wonderful stay at L’Ma Lodge in Skoura.  We had booked this trip for March 2020, but COVID intervened and we ended up going 18 months later.  We had read the reviews, but did not know if the lodge would still be as attractive as before the pandemic.  When we drove down a long, dirt road, we started to wonder if we had made the right choice.  We got to the front door, and the lodge is marked only by a small sign.  Initially nobody answered the door…but eventually we were greeted by the friendliest gentleman who welcomed us and immediately introduced us to Vanessa who built the lodge with her husband.

This place would suit a couple wanting to spend some romantic days, a group of friends but also a family (as there are some very nice playgrounds for kids.

Doubtlessly one of the most special places in Morocco and one I will for sure return to, and recommend among friends ",5.0
Visited L’Ma in April via a tour traveling from Merzouga and were so surprised how excellent the lodge/hotel is. It is located deep within the city outline (small roads to arrive) and upon arrival we felt we just arrived in paradise.   The lodge owner greeted us and we felt like king and queen and just so special immediately. The lodge is small (I believe only 7 rooms) but this helps hold the unique charm and relaxation environment with many locations within the resort to just “chill” and enjoy the grounds and nature. Great views of the Atlas snow capped mountains on upper relaxation area of rooftop. The rooms are extremely elegant and new with so much attention to every detail (never seen this perfect extreme detail in any other lodge room!)The food is just excellent and along…,5.0

We stayed in several different places over the course of the two weeks - but L'Ma Lodge was a completely different experience.  It wasn't in a large city so, we weren't sure what the rooms or meals would be like.  Let me tell you that staying here was magical.  The energy of the place was so serene and the owner, Vanessa, was as graceful as the lodge she has created.  Strolling past the pomegranate trees and palms on the way to our room, showering in a private outdoor shower and enjoying a delicious dinner and breakfast were fantastic.",5.0

We were welcomed by the staff & on arrival the owner gave us a personal tour of her home, the grounds full of vegetables, fruit trees, rescue animal zoo & swimming pool.  Our room was in the Riad with views of trees from our room on the top floor so calm & quiet. The evening meal was Moroccan with local musicians playing & dancing.

The property layout is well organized and includes areas for relaxing poolside, naps in hammocks, and comfortable seating areas for reading a book or having lunch.  The staff are extremely friendly and attentive and knowledgeable.  The food is excellent.  This hotel is perfect for couples and small families.  From outside Marrakech to Fes, and the towns in between, it’s unlikely you’ll find a better hotel.  Horseback rides through the palm grove are available at a nearby stable.",5.0

By our second evening we stayed up late into the night have an interesting and informative chat with the Manager about Morocco and it’s culture.  All staff were kind and attentive.  After seeing my love of cats they brought us to where a new batch of kittens had been born in the morning.   Not to mention the hotel itself.

"L'Ma Lodge, although not as luxe as some of our other Morocco accommodations, was by far our favorite!  Vanessa and her family have created a true oasis in the middle of what honestly felt like the middle of nowhere (don't be alarmed by the rustic surroundings and dirt roads!).  Our room was charming and the property was filled with delightful touches, including countless, intimate seating areas.  We loved playing bocce ball and badminton, and the heated pool was just perfect.  The rooftop was ideal for star watching--honestly, we it was prettier than in the Sahara!    The restaurant was among the best of our trip, with much of the food coming straight from the garden.  I'm still dreaming of the goat cheese salad from dinner and the 10+ jam options at breakfast!!

"Wow! If you will be in the area, or happen to be taking the drive from Marrakesh to the Sahara, you MUST stay at L'ma Lodge. Even if you are not planning to be in the area, it is worth the drive! L'ma Lodge is truly something special. My wife and I were in Morocco for part of our Honeymoon and were taking the drive from Marrakesh to Merzouga and decided to stay at L'ma Lodge as a half way point as it had been recommended to us by a friend. Our only mistake was not staying for at least 2 nights! We arrived at night after a long drive and were beyond exhausted and hungry. Stepping inside the door to this magical retreat, we could not have received a warmer welcome. The staff had arranged for us a late night dinner as we were arriving later in the evening due to our travel plans.…",5.0
"After a wonderful desert experience and a long drive, the L’ma Lodge provided a most welcome respite from the barren landscape. The owners have created a lovely tree filled oasis where shade and foliage were abundant.  The indoor spaces were simply and elegantly designed to create a soft and calming spot to relax. We also enjoyed a sumptuous dinner under the stars and the breakfast was fabulous with the largest assortment of homemade jams I’ve ever seen.  I could easily see why so many choose to stay much longer.",5.0
"After driving through desert landscapes we literally arrived in an oasis. Walking through the gates of L’Ma we instantly knew it was really nice. Between the open air arrival area, thick lush grass, tropical plants, trees and  refreshing welcome tea it was like walking into a relaxing oasis. Our room was bright with screened windows to enjoy the breeze at night, air conditioner (not needed), great shower pressure and very comfortable bed. We especially loved the pool and pool area. We spent most of our days at the pool just relaxing on the comfortable beds enjoying being surrounded by a lush garden. We had lunch and dinners here. This was some of the best food we’ve had.  Everything was fresh from the garden to table. The dinners were incredible and different each of the 4…",5.0
"We loved this place!   It was a long day of driving in torrential rain.  We were greeted so warmly by the staff and ushered to our lovely rooms to rest before dinner.   The dinner we had was one of the best of our trip to Morocco - a lovely salad with goat cheese and the best chicken tagine of the whole trip.   The hotel is beautifully appointed - a mix of traditional and modern.  The gardens are lovely - so many wonderful little spots to sit and enjoy a book, a coffee, or a glass of wine.   Our only regret is that we only had one night.  I would definitely suggest spending 2 or 3 days at this lovely oasis.",5.0
"We stopped here for one night on our way to the Sahara.  It was incredibly peaceful; there was only one other couple staying at the lodge that night.  Rooms are in a building separate from the main lodge building and are well-appointed and very comfortable.  The bathroom light fixture was beautiful!  The gardens are lush with a lot of spots to sit and contemplate what a special place you are experiencing.  Dinner was outside on the terrace, with flickering candles and delicious food.  The buffet breakfast had many options.  Finally, the staff were very hospitable and welcoming.  I highly recommend L'Ma Lodge.",5.0
"This lodge is like a dream. Enchanting gardens, beautiful stylish rooms, friendly, kind staff and delicious food. The owners have created a paradise in Skoura, I’d recommend a couple of nights as a stopover on your way to or from the desert. One of the best places I’ve ever stayed. I’d love to return. ",5.0
"After a long driving day from the desert, the last part of which was in heavy rain, we arrived at L’ma to perfection with a warm welcome from the staff.   The owners have masterfully blended traditional handmade Moroccan crafts with a European aesthetic.  Commodious, elegant, welcoming, and comfortable.  In the garden there are endless charming sitting areas, some with tables and chairs and others with colourful scattered throw rugs and pillows under dappled light. We were enchanted.  The rooms, continuing the Moroccan/European aesthetic are calm and elegant.  The dinner was outstanding, from the excellent salad with goat cheese and fresh lettuces, to the tagine of chicken figs and almonds. Expertly done, a perfect balance of the savoury chicken, sweetness of the figs and crunch…",5.0
"We have spent two days here relaxing before returning to Marrakesh airport. These were two fabulous days that have put the ‘cherry’ on top of an already great Maroccan roundtrip. Coming from the N10 you easily need to follow the signs some 6 kms. You may be surprised initially driving through a group of berber buildings first, but the real surprise will be when you enter the oasis of the ‘palmerie’ palmtree yard of l’Ma. The gardens are beautiful, huge and very well managed. The clean rooms are spacious and stylish decorated in a kind of modern tribal Maroccan way. The main building could be a setting for a design magazine. But their absolute treasure is their kitchen. All diners and breakfast have been by far the best we had on our Maroccan roundtrip. Having a Wallonian/French…",5.0
"My wife and I are from California and we happened to spend one night at L’ma Lodge as we were enroute to Marrakech from the Sahara. Upon arriving the staff was very welcoming and pleasant. Vanessa, the owner of the lodge was superbly kind and gave us a brief tour of the place. She told us about how environmentally friendly the company is, and how they rescued some stray animals as well. The place itself seemed refreshing in comparison to other places we’ve stayed. It felt like a luxurious home away from home. The amenities included bocci ball court, swimming pool, multiple lounge and hammock areas. My only regret is that we only spent one night.",5.0
"After a long drive from Erfoud, we spent one night in this small boutique-type hotel in the middle of a large oasis. Perfect stopover. Beautifully created and furnished with obvious great love, style and attention. There is a large garden with a delightful swimming pool and a number of restful sitting areas. As we arrived, we were taken into the kitchen to meet the cook and to discuss the dinner menu. The staff all delightful with a real sense of humour. Dinner was excellent - as was breakfast the next day. We left fully rested - and rejuvenated. Highly recommended.",5.0

My husband and I spent two lovely days under the care of Vanessa and her fantastic team at L'Ma Lodge. Her attention to detail and care taken towards all who stayed in her home was impeccable and we cannot recommend them more highly. You will not regret spending some time in this beautiful oasis within an oasis.,5.0
"This was as amazing property and our favorite stay throughout Morocco. I just wish there was more to do in the area so that we could stay longer. It was a perfect spot for relaxing in the oasis. We had a large, 2 room suite with a separate living area on the lower floor.  We spent most of our time relaxing under the trees and on the rooftop in some of the many outdoor seating areas.   Vanessa made us feel so welcome and at home. L'Ma Lodge reminds me so much of some of the nicer agriturismos in Italy. It is certainly perfect for families, with playgrounds, a pool, badminton, and even a bocce court.   The food was also excellent, some of the best we had in Morocco. And everything was fresh from the garden and weekly market.",5.0
"Absolutely charming and lovely. We arrived late in the day after a long drive from Marrakech. We were greeted by Charlie and Milo, (the owner) Vanessa’s children, along with sweet Brahim. Such a warm welcome. We all knew this was going to be special.   After a short tour of the property with Vanessa, we were shown our rooms. Very comfortable, charming and cozy with modern amenities. A complete antithesis to our stay at The Four Seasons in Marrakech, but we all loved L’Ma Lodge in so many other ways.   The main house serves as a meeting place for everyone. Different nooks to choose from to to sit and relax, much like the property itself (the grounds are wonderful). Cocktails and wine were available, and it was so nice to just sit back and do nothing. When we were ready to eat…",5.0
"This gem is absolutely beyond 5 stars! We travel around the world and L'Ma was one of our top three places ever! Vanessa and Javier have truly created a unique, creative, relaxing and special place. We arrived late and our only regret is not staying longer. The rooms and main house are perfectly curated with lovely art pieces, textiles, all in their proper places. The staff was extremely help and kind. Then there is the rescued animals, the healthy cats, the organic garden, the pool space, bocce ball, and the grounds. Going to sleep in the comfy beds to the sound of crickets was a dream. Every detail was well visioned and it shows. You must stay here - you won't regret it!",5.0

From the moment we walked in we felt so comfortable and welcome, our room was spacious, gorgeous and luxurious.

We rented bikes and spent one day biking around the oasis using a hand-drawn map from one of the staff at the Lodge.  Everything was perfect.  Thank you so much!",5.0
This place is a wonderful paradise. A wonderful garden in the heart of the oasis. The rooms are big and magnificent decorated. Breakfast and dinner are excellent. We had homemade jam from fruits from the garden they tasted excellent. SOUFIANE and his staff did everything to let us feel like home. I strongly recommend this place for a wonderful and relaxing stay.,5.0

The family who owns and runs the place have created a lovely spot with gardens, beach ball, bocce ball, a kids playground and lots of little places to sit under the palm trees.

We couldn’t have been more comfortable; the bathroom, immaculate, has great products and shower. The Moroccan design of the hotel incorporates African elements; all around the property are secret lounging areas tucked in among the trees as well as a beautiful roof-top with more seating to view the sunset!

We were there for only a night, but I'd love to go back and stay when it's warmer and we could take advantage of the grounds and the pool. Our room was exceptional (it was actually a family room that really is--separate areas for two twins and another for a queen, and then a sitting area). The entire place is beautifully decorated.

We visited L’ma lodge for the day and had lunch as it was fully booked. I travel alone with 2 children and could not get a better welcome. This is a place to go to and forget about the outside world and feel very safe in the service minded hands of all the people working there. It is amazing what the family who runs the hotel have accomplished. The garden seems neverending and everywhere there are comfy cushions to sit on under lanterns carefully placed all around... it is a mini paradise... and this due to the passion and warmth of the people who run/ and work there. Thank you for an amazing day! Oh yes! The lunch was delicious! Animals are installed on the paradise as are games for both kids and grownups...

All the creature comforts were covered.  The bed, pillows and sheets felt comforting, and I slept like a baby! Dinner was outstanding.  Breakfast was wonderful.

We had an amazing dinner prepared by the chef, and it was definitely of Michelin quality. Our breakfast was incredible! They put out more than 10 types of jams and spreads, all made in-house from the fruits and vegetables they grow in the garden.

Nothing was too much trouble and the owner gave us a tour of the property when we arrived.  I think the owner mentioned that she had worked for Club Med previously. You could tell - everything was spot on. The rooms were beautiful. Even the toiletries were really lovely and the outdoor areas were paradise. My biggest regret was that we weren’t staying longer.

It was a long drive from Marrakech but it was 100% worth it, nestling in an Oasis within the beautiful landscape of this part of the Atlas Mountains, the owners have obviously put their hearts and souls into creating such a charming place to stay. The owner even made her own tiles! They organised 2 camels for us to ride on with 2 children on each camel and then we each jumped up as well for part of the jaunt.

Oh, and on-site herb and vegetable gardens too! The rooms were beautifully appointed and contained everything we could need. They were welcoming and artfully designed for comfort and elegance. Everything was airy and bright.  Dinner was delicious  (though our server was saddened by our dislike of eggplant) and the breakfast buffet delightful.  We enjoyed…",5.0
"My dad and I stopped here on a recommendation from a friend who visited on her Honeymoon, and we are SO glad we did. After a week of rougher accommodations in Morocco, arriving at L'Ma Lodge was a breath of fresh air, literally. The roses were in bloom and the gardens were stunning. We spent a heavenly afternoon reading in hammocks by the pool, relaxing on pillows, and watching sunset from the roof, before enjoying a delicious dinner. I would go out of my way to visit L'Ma again, and wish we had more than 24 hours there.",5.0

My wife and I lucked out to get a room at Lma during the high season and it was the highlight of our trip. Sufjian and the whole staff were the most gracious hosts who met every need for us during our stay. It’s a must to eat at the lodges restaurant where we had the best meals of our entire trip. The grounds and  surrounding Palmerie are also a treat to enjoy. This is one of the best hotels we’ve ever been to. ,5.0
First you try to find the right road. Then you start down the road and begin to think your driver is lost. Suddenly you arrive to a magical place. The Lodge was constructed on an old football field using traditional methods and modern sensibility. It is stunning. They have planted 3000 plants and set set up multiple areas to relax and unwind.  This is a real mix of sophisticated and traditional. They grow some of their vegetables and herbs.  The food and the dining area are beautifully done and the food is traditional and excellent with some French touches. The owners are hands-on and attentive. The rooms are excellent. Go when it's warm and spend at least 2 nights to relax and restore yourself.,5.0
"Oh, how I wish we could have stayed more than one night. The grounds just call you to relax...by the pool, in a grove of trees, behind some bushes...all sorts of private nooks and crannies set up with chairs and cushions calling...come here, sit and relax!  The meals were excellent, as well. This is an out-of-the-way gem that's worth searching for!!",5.0

From the moment you are greeted by the front door, so much care and attention has been made to ensure your time there is as relaxing and care free as possible.   We loved all the little chill out spots dotted around and the amazing welcome drinks & snacks when we arrived.   The meal in the evening was delicious and hearing that some of the produce was grown within the grounds of the hotel made it even more special.   A true oasis of calm.   If I could give 6 stars I would!   We will be returning!  ",5.0

It is so relaxing, a little oasis.  We had dinner and breakfast there.  Dinner was so good!  And most of the ingredients are grown right there!  The salad was exceptionally delicious.  Breakfast was very nice as well.  I would definitely recommend staying here!",5.0

"After navigating through what could most kindly be described as the back blocks of a nondescript village, entering the front gate to L’ma Lodge is an entrée to a world apart. This boutique seven-room lodge is a character stay par excellence. This personal creation of the owners it is filled with a collection of furnishings and cultural artefacts from across Africa.  Much of the facility is al fresco – an embarrassment of amenities set amongst the expansive palm-drenched gardens of the property and atop the guest’s room building.

The staff, in our case especially Soufiane, made us feel so very welcome but unfortenately we were not able to show our appreciation to Vanessa and Xavier who were abroad at the time. Food was excellent and the ambiance during the dinner so calm and lovely. To stand on the roof terrace in the morning listening to the birds singing and seeing how the rising sun colored the mountains behind the palm groves was one of the most relaxing and memorable moments of my trip.

We spent one night as we exited the Sahara Desert and were taken back by the beauty and peacefulness of this oasis. The room was very comfortable and homely and the staff was warm and very helpful.

We would love to comeback and unwind for several days to enjoy the peace in the desert.,5.0

We hope to someday go back!",5.0

The fact that we returned says enough about this lovely place to stay in the palm groves of Skoura, but I will continue...From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome by Vanessa and her staff. Soufiane, the Manager, gave us a choice of rooms and served us a delicious 'welcome' drink of fresh pomegranate juice with homemade biscuits and just-picked sweet dates from the garden.

"Our first stay during our trip through Morocco was at L'Ma Lodge. We drove there from Marrakech airport, a trip that took approximately 5 hours. It was a beautiful trip through the mountains.  When we arrived at the Lodge the owner immediately welcomed us. She has a very warm personality. The rooms are amazing, every detail has been taken care of. Great bathroom, furniture, accessories. The swimming pool is also great (a little cold for us!) At night the kitchen staff cooked us a delicious vegetarian meal: it was so good we took some left overs with us so we could eat it for lunch in our car the next day. It was a pity we only stayed at the Lodge for one night, we could have stayed for a week and enjoy their fresh dates, pomegranates and almonds a lot more! See you next time!",5.0

Vanessa is a great host and greeted us on arrival, served us a brilliant welcome drink and showed us to the room. She gave us a short tour of the garden, pool and all the relaxing places the guest house offers. The garden was mind blowing and pretty much all the salads, juices and jams that were served at meals were home grown (even the olive oil was pressed in house)! Rooms were neat and clean, spacious and tastefully decorated. Dinner was a 3-course meal which was delicious, as was the breakfast of home made Moroccan pancakes and home made jams!

Vanessa and her staff are very welcoming, the gardens and grounds are just incredible. We played bocce, had beers and ate snacks at dusk, in the morning hung out in the hammocks before the pool - just a dream! We stayed in some other ‘fancy’ places that on the surface were similar, but nothing compares to the authenticity of both the people and grounds of here. I’d highly recommend (plus we’ll definitely be back!). Thanks again Vanessa!",5.0

It's probably the best decision we made on our first visit to Morocco. Initial communication from the owners, with driving directions, was within a week of booking.

The lighting was calm and soothing and the many nooks and crannies within the garden would be an ideal retreat to relax for a few days.  The dinner was perhaps my favourite throughout my whole two week stay in Morocco an exceptional home cooked Euro style Moroccan fusion Tagine with a delicious salad home grown within the gardens.   Breakfast included a number of home made jams and preserves and fresh hot coffee. The waiter at breakfast was surly and abrupt however this was a minor bump on an…,5.0
"L'ma Lodge is truly a hidden gem.  You would have no idea that you were going to arrive at such a place when you are driving down the narrow lanes to get there.  Once the gate opens you realize you are in a touch of paradise.  Vanessa, the owner, had exceptional taste in decor and she and her partner have created a beautiful retreat in the middle of the Palm grove.  The design of the interiors and the gardens is fantastic.  I loved walking around just looking at all the design touches.  The welcome was lovely with a pot of tea and some yummy sweets.  The rooms were stylish and very clean.  The food was excellent and the kitchen was very accommodating of our allergies.

"This beautiful hotel has the most delightful large outdoor private garden. There are many areas to sit and relax on chairs, cushions, hammocks in beautifully landscaped arrangements. The outdoor pool looked lovely.  The buffet breakfast included 15 types of homemade jams and preserves that were the best we had on our entire trip. They also had crepes (Moroccan & French), breads, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt and eggs.  Rooms were quite nice and beds very comfortable.Service was warm and friendly.",5.0
"L'Ma Lodge is a very special small retreat lovingly created by the talented, gracious and welcoming owner, Vanessa LaGarde. Handmade signs direct you down a small unpaved road through an oasis of orchards to the beautiful lodge. The gardens, suites and terraces alone are extremely attractive, but in addition there are beautiful intimate spaces inside and out for relaxing and reviving from trips in the Atlas Mountains. On top of that, the incredibly fresh organic food is mostly grown on the property and beautifully and inventively prepared. The staff could not be nicer. Very highly recommended. ",5.0

"the creators of this property get many kudos first they had to imagine a guest lodge and accompanying facilities and locate it in what was then an ordinary palm grove. then they arranged gorgeous plantings, creative settings, and lots of fun activities.  a surprise awaits around every bend in the path.   of course, good food, good service, and a friendly atmosphere combine to make this place magical",5.0

"Everything about L'Ma is perfect. We loved the personal welcome from Vanessa and then the coffee and tea which we so needed after our long day of travel. The dinner (we had requested a vegetarian meal) was one of the best we had on our 12 day trip.  I am still remembering the organic locally sourced salad and the Berber omelette,  The main house has the dining area and currently the wifi,  We were informed that the lodge with the rooms will have wifi shortly.  The rooms are very well equipped and the setting with the gardens and terrace with Atlas Mountain views are just perfect. We will have to return for a longer stay.",5.0

The rooms are beautiful and comfortable, the main house is fabulous, the breakfast had an amazing level of choice of fantastic food, the service was great but best of all is the gardens, the sound of the birds, the fountains and the grounds.

In the morning there were >15 kinds of home made preserves, jams, and jellies and, while we wished there were warm eggs, the volume of choices meant everyone found something delicious.

"It's hard to know where to start on the good things to say about L'Ma Lodge: magical garden, beautiful rooms, fantastic food, super-friendly people. The garden is bigger than it looks on the website. It is full of date palms, fruit and nut trees of all sorts (pomegranates, almonds, olives and many more), gorgeous grasses, roses, vines, vegetables and herbs. The garden is laid out beautifully to create private corners and hidden places; where you'll find a hammock, or a shelter, or cushions and carpets to relax on. Lanterns give it a magical aspect in the evenings. There is a fantastic boules court, shaded by overhanging trees, and a lovely swimming pool.

"Our only regret, having arrived at the Lodge, was that we waited till nightfall to arrive. The drive to the Lodge is an adventure by itself, winding through very narrow village pot bellied lanes. The owner of the Lodge, Venessa was there to greet us at the gates, and her enthusiasm to make us feel welcome at her ""home"" became obvious from the time we checked-in, which did not take long.  The main lobby and restaurant area, the rooms and the grounds, have the hallmarks of been designed out of love, and it was love that we felt for the place. My highlight was getting up at the crack of dawn to see the Morrocon sun come up, bathing the whole area in its orange hue - and what a sight it was, you can see vistas of the atlas and parts of the desert landscape from the roof.  All in all…",5.0
"My husband and I love Morocco and have visited Marrakech four times and have ventured on many day trips. This time we decided to be rather more adventurous and head to the Sahara desert. En route, to break up the long drive, we stayed at L'ma Lodge and what a wonderful surprise it was. The main house and the guest house, set in amazing grounds, exceeded any expectations. From the moment we arrived and sipped 'Welcome Tea"" in the gardens to the moment we departed after a most splendid breakfast, we were in awe! The warmth and friendliness of the owners and the staff made us feel welcome and special, the evening meal was a real treat. It was a set meal, no menus, we just sat by the fire and were waited on. Each course was superb! My husband is a strict vegetarian and was his meal…",5.0
"L'Ma is a wonderful surprise after driving hours from the desert. The location is amazing. I loved everything about this place -- the story of how the owners built the lodge themselves (incredible craftsmanship and taste), grow most all of the fruit and vegetables used by the chef, the flower and trees, my gorgeous room and bathroom, the rooftop strewn with rugs and pillows for hanging out while the sun sets, chattering birds in the palm trees.  I had a little terrace off my second floor room that I wish I could have stayed and stared into the sky and trees for a very long time. It's very hard to find this kind of peace and tranquility.",5.0
"We stayed at L'Ma lodge twice while on our recent trip to Morocco. We only intended to stay once, but ended up coming back unexpectedly after our trip in the desert, since we underestimated the time it takes to drive places. Both times, we were amazed by the hospitality that Vanessa, the owner, showed us. The rooms and the grounds are impeccably kept. The decor is so lovely that I considered hiring Vanessa to decorate my apartment!! The food was amazing. I could have stayed for weeks.   If you go, don't miss going up to the roof to watch the sunset, and be sure you walk through the palm groves next to the property. And say hi to all the cats!",5.0

"My sister and I were fortunate to stay at L'Ma Lodge for 2 nights in November while on our way to Marrakech from the desert.  It was the perfect place to relax and recharge.  Some of the highlights: - Vanessa is the owner and visionary of this beautiful boutique hotel.  She is an incredible hostess and will make you feel right at home.  Nothing is too much trouble and her talents, creativity, consideration, and warmth.  She can organize day trips and a variety of activities for guests for short and extended stays. - Lovely garden to enjoy and a lot of what you will eat will come from the garden too!  There are pomegranate trees, olive trees, and beautiful roses.  While we were there they were preparing the ground to grow wheat (very cool). - Best electricity we experienced in…",5.0
"A small, beautiful hideway in a great setting. I have nothing but good to say about L'Ma lodge, it is quite simply one of the nicest places I have ever stayed. Highlights for me include the home grown olive oil, fresh dates from the garden and the wide range of delicious homemade jams at breakfast. The food is great and cook uses many home grown ingredients. The lodge is very children friendly with a small playground and a swimming pool that is great for even quite young children.  Vanessa is the perfect hostess and her small number of (devoted) staff are quite wonderful. The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated - they even have ceiling fans rather than air conditioning ( a big thumbs up from me).  I would love to visit here again!",5.0
"This is a truly dreamy place to stay. (Sadly we were here for one night only). Welcomed as we arrived by Vanessa, who took time to show us around the impeccably kept grounds. Rooms are spacious, airy, light and so tastefully decorated. Dinner was divine with fresh produce from their garden. Must return here for longer.",5.0
"our stay at Vanessa and Xavier’s L’Ma lodge was lovely. She and her husband extremely well organised, and that becomes apparent soon as you walk into the (neat, tasteful and charming) property. She is quite jovial, and makes you feel at home quickly (like at a good B&B).   The rooms were lovely, clean, and the property itself is a nice place to walk around, especially if you are interested in seeing birds. they have a lovely pool, which is kept covered when not in use…therefore quite clean. They also have a lovely informal area to lounge around..on a well finished concrete floor under a tree. In addition, there are dining seating options both inside and outside. we loved having various fruit trees around us all over the property, especially as they attracted birds. last but not…",5.0

It is beautifully decorated as well as being very comfortable and quiet  The food was delicious, using all homegrown materials. The gardens are full of olive trees and pomegranite trees among others. L'Ma Lodge definitely deserves a stay of at least 2 nights to really enjoy all that it offers. There is an outdoor pool and bocce ball court. Wifi is available in the main hotel but not in the room.",5.0
"L'Ma Lodge is an outstanding place to stay in Skoura, with lovely rooms, great food, swimming pool, and lovely grounds for relaxation.  Vanessa and Xavier are exceptional hosts who will help you plan adventures from the lodge.  It would be helpful to rent a car in Ouazarzate to go to Skoura and do day trips beyond, but you can also go there by taxi and then the hosts will help you arrange tours and taxis from L'Ma Lodge.

"L'Ma Lodge is a magical place, very much an oasis in the desert. The garden is a perfect place filled with palms, fruit trees and flowers, a lovely pool, reading spots complete with hammocks and even a petanque (bacci ball) court.  The rooms in the riad are as well appointed and comfortable as in many 5 star hotels and contain a lovely variety of art from the African continent. The rooftop has sitting areas and is a good place to watch the sun go down (or up).  The dining-room and gathering spots are located in the main house.

We loved staying in this idyllic and serene property.  The host and owner Vanessa is delightful.

The grounds are very large and lush with different unique spots to sit and relax including a heated outdoor pool. Although the grounds are large there are not that many rooms so your stay intimate and  private.  They grow their own fresh produce that you get to enjoy at meal time.

"Vanessa is not only a true professional but also very friendly and welcoming.  We were struck by the attention to details everywhere, all in good taste. It made us want to forget the rest of the trip and stay there for a week. L'Ma Lodge is the place to be in Skoura. Vanessa also organized the rest of our trip to Morocco with regular follow-up while on the road and good guides who were knowledgeable in all areas of Morroco. Encore merci.",5.0

Not to mention a wonderful sunset that can be watched from the roof terrace of the guest house.",5.0
"L'Ma Lodge is not only situated in an oasis, it is an oasis itself: palm- and olive trees spread their branches above thick carpets of green lawn, roses and oleander flourish on each side of the many paths. Everywhere you find little cozy niches with hammocks, rugs and cushions and small tables to put your drinks on. All rooms are very tastefully decorated in a modern way of arranging traditional Moroccan handicraft items. What made this place so memorable is the personal drive, presence and passion of the owner Vanessa. She and everybody else around is incredibly friendly and helpful so that it is easy to forget the world around. This atmosphere made L'Ma Lodge clearly the best and outstanding choice on our entire trip through Morocco. We arrived here after some days in the…",5.0
"Loved l'ma lodge. The food was excellent, especially the lemon milk dessert...I still have dreams about it :) This place was a real treat for us, it has a wonderful relaxing homey feel. The rooms were big and well furnished with comfortable beds and sitting area even though we spent most of the time in the pool! And it was probably the only time we walked on grass in morocco! The host Vanessa took very good care of us and even set up a walking tour through the oasis of farm plots and how the irrigation system worked, it was well worth it, very interesting. Thanks again Vanessa, we really enjoyed the couple night we spent there!",5.0

My only regret was not having more time here, as exploring the kasbahs and palmeries nearby is a day by itself.",5.0
"We were not at all surprised to hear that a previous guest had cancelled an entire tour of Morocco in order to extend their stay with Benissa at the L'Ma Lodge. We arrived hot and dirty from an adventure in the desert, on our way back towards Marrakech. We found a veritable haven of beauty, comfort and hospitality: a beautiful garden, best with discreet seating areas and comfortable cushions; a really beautiful room; wonderful food; and good conversation. It helped perhaps that there were few other guests: it felt as if we were the house guests of particularly tasteful and convivial friends. The view of the sunset over the palm trees was memorable. A great job by Benissa and her husband; and another excellent choice by Naturally Morocco.",5.0

What we found was one of the best parts of our entire trip.  The surrounding area is fairly desolate, with tiny villages and desert landscape all around.  We came upon the door to the riad, stepped inside, and felt like we entered into a hidden paradise.  The grounds are absolutely immaculate.  The photos, while very nice, do not do this place justice in the slightest.  It is a fairly large property, with a sizable pool, various tree covered seating areas, a bocce court (!), and other little hidden treasures throughout.  The main building was perfectly decorated and it is abundantly clear…",5.0
This place was booked as part of our tour and we hadn't really looked at what it was like.  We arrived to the amazing front door to be opened onto their stunning grounds and gardens.  Fantastic places to lounge play cards and have a drink after a long drive.  Words can not do justice to the care and thought that has gone into creating something very special.  Our boys loved the pool (obviously) and also the seating areas under the trees to play cards. Dinner was a fixed menu included and was a stunning feast made with products from the garden and the local markets (the fig and goats cheese salad with honey dressing was stunning) and our whole family had a lovely feast. Our room was equally well designed for a family of four and was just perfect. Breakfast was also a delight.,5.0

In the middle is a pool, several sitting areas and several walking paths that ultimately connect the two buildings.

When we first arrived we were straight away made to feel very welcome and throughout our stay Vanessa was on hand to ensure we had everything we needed and to give us tips on where to visit and where to shop etc. The simply furnished accommodation, set in beautiful grounds, was perfect for our needs, and the food, sourced mainly with local ingredients, was excellent.

"Le Petit Riad is a very comfortable place to stay in Ouarzazate.  Although it fronts the airport runway and is a 5-10 min taxi ride to Kasbah Taourirt (20 dirhams), don’t let that put you off.  Behind its high wall and imposing front door lies an oasis of serenity.  Entry to the house is via a small, tropical garden and once you're inside you realise you're in for a treat.  The main reception area is tastefully furnished with stone floor, decorated pillars and arches, a central fountain, etc.  From the reception area it's a few steps to the outside pool area draped in bougainvillea.  There are a number of shady spots to sit and read around the pool together with plenty of sun loungers with towels provided.     Eating outside in the evenings is a delight.  The food is excellent and the service superb.  If you choose to have dinner, you decide at breakfast time what and when you would like to eat.  House red and white wine and beer are available at reasonable prices.  Breakfast was good.   The rooms are comfortable and everything works well.  Two bedrooms are upstairs, the rest downstairs.  Beds are large and comfortable though on the hard side.  En-suites have showers with plentiful hot water.  There is no safe.  Air conditioning works well.  Windows are double glazed so you won’t hear planes landing or taking off (which, in any case, happens rarely).  We slept very well there.  The Riad’s decor is a riot of colour for want of a better description.  Each bedroom is distinctive in terms of furnishings, paint colours and fabrics without being flashy.    Where Le Petit Riad scores heavily is the staff.  They were great - engaging and very helpful without being intrusive.  Fatima, the owner, was on hand to greet us and bid us farewell - a nice touch.  We felt part of the Le Petit Riad family.     Full marks from us therefore.  They have a winning formula.  It is good value too.…",5.0

Facilities excellent, the pool and surrounding patios are beautiful, sun beds with cushions and hats for guests.",5.0
My wife and I stayed one night in a ground floor room facing the road. The room consisted of a queen bed and single bed.

The windy conditions did not make it ideal for us to have a swim. Both the young men that run the riad made us feel welcome. The evening meal and breakfast were both enjoyable. Don't be misled by the austere appearance on the outside - it is quite charming inside. My only faults were the bed was too firm and the shower was slow to drain. Nevertheless we will stay here again.,4.0
We stayed at Le Petit Riad Ouarzazate for one night in April 2019. The staff were friendly. Breakfast was very good. The room we stayed in was clean. It even had a private patio but we did not get the chance to use it. Parking is available on the street outside the hotel. This riad is easy to drive to.,5.0
"During our recent trip though Morocco we had the absolute pleasure of staying a the Petit Riad in Quarzazate.  If we could we would rate it 5+  What an experience !!!!!  Wonderful and warm welcome.  An incredibly well appointed Riad.  Staff and owner gracious and so courteous.  We had one  of the best suppers, perhaps ever, there.    Treat yourself to the experience if you go to Morocco  and Quarazate",5.0
"check in was easy. staff warm and friendly. food delicious. nice pool area. we stayed in Chrade room which was ORANGE. Tile work in the bathroom was amazing but after a while it hurt to look at.

"Spend one night there after a trip to the dunes. The two male staff ( apologies cannot remember their names) we met were friendly, helpful, the friendliest staff we have met in Morocco. It was an absolute delight to stay there - helped by their hospitality.  The Riad is traditional clean, comfortable , great night sleep and the best evening meal I have had in the 5 days I have been in Morocco. I highly recommend it.  Thanks Le Petit Riad ",5.0
"My wife & I have done a 6 night self drive tour around Morocco & Le Petit Riad is easily the best one we have stayed at. We had the blue Room & had the best nights sleep for months !!! The two lads who work there with the owner Fatima could not have been more welcoming, helpful and attentive. We did not eat at the Riad but followed their recommendation of Le Jardin Aromme. The breakfast was brilliant. I cannot rank this Riad high enough. ",5.0
"I loved the hospitality of this riad. The gentlemen who ran this riad where so inviting and welcoming. The welcome cookies were the first dessert we had in Morocco that had flavor! The were delicious. The dinner was authentic Moroccan and very tasty. The breakfast, overwhelming in the quantity and quality. The room was very comfortable and inviting. I wish the weather was better as the pool was so beautiful as was the view from the terrace. Do not pass this riad up. You will feel like family at this this riad, as that is how welcoming they are. This is a first rate riad!!!!",5.0

We only spent one night in this lovely Riad. They staff made us feel like being at home. There attention to detail was on point! Being Vegetarian and Gluten intolerant. I have to say this was hands down the best Tagine I had in all the days we were in Morocco. Breakfast was also really good and hats off to the chef. Thank you Boys you made are night in Ouarzazate a special one.,5.0
"We would recommend to any of our friends to stay here.    We arrived after a four hour drive to very well made Moroccan tea!  (Believe me, once you’ve been in the country a few weeks you have much experience).  They made the “check-in” experience very simple, we didn’t even realize that while we had been drinking tea they had carried all our luggage to our room and carefully placed it.  After check-in there was lots of information provided; lights, room, patios, and options for dinner time and place as well as breakfast.  This was appreciated! The customer service provided by two young men (I wish I remembered their names) was incredible!  We’ve been in Morocco for over two weeks and was one of the best customer experiences we’ve had.    We had lemon chicken tagine, a Moroccan…",5.0
"We heard about this place from other travellers, and were really grateful: it was a real discovery! The riad is small but immaculately kept and extremely well run. The food is superb, and is like home cooking - some of the best we had in Morocco. And the staff are kind and attentive, and make you feel like their personal guests. The rooms are well appointed, and also kept in perfect shape.",5.0
We just spent one night here but was enough to enjoy this nice and clean place. The place is directly operated by the owner (Fatima). Food quality is excellent (great chef).  The staff is highly friendly and ready for service.  I personally like the patio with a pool and buganvilia flowers.  Note for Spanish speakers: Fátima habla perfecto español pues tiene estudios en literatura hispana.,5.0
"This is not the grandest riad, but I cannot see how you can find better service and hospitality anywhere! Lahcen and Karim do a fantastic job of anticipating your every need with genuine warmth and enthusiasm. Even the night watchman was super friendly and helpful. This is a great place to stay and after a long drive, the pool makes it even better.",5.0
"Stayed here for 2 nights with my family, and must say that it was the most beautiful hospitality experience I have ever had. The staff were without fail the loveliest people I’ve come across. They did everything in their power to accomodate us, make us comfortable, and help us with anything we needed. The location itself was beautiful, a quiet sanctuary with a much needed pool when travelling Morocco in summer. Food was beautiful and the best we had. Wonderful place to stay.",5.0

"I brought a group of 7 people to this charming riad on one of my Kitchen Jazz tours and was not disappointed. After a long journey from Essouira, we were made to feel extremely welcome and comfortable. After settling into our beautifully decorated rooms, we had a refreshing drink by the pool under the bougainvillea. This was a true oasis. Dinner was served on the terrace and it was absolutely delicious!  So flavoursome and making traditional local food truly shine. Fatima and her helpful staff were on hand to ensure that we were happy and well fed. They succeeded! I thoroughly recommended that you stay here when visiting Ouarzazate, especially if you are driving further into the desert (or on your way home from the desert). Such wonderful memories were created there. I will…",5.0
"I can't express just how much I loved this riad. It is gorgeous! And don't even get me started on my room. Impeccable and tastefully decorated. I even had an adjoining terrace. Such a treat! The pool is quite lovely and a nice place to relax at the end of the day. Dinner was delicious and plentiful. I couldn't finish it because of the large portion sizes. Breakfast was also another highlight. It was great having my meals by the pool. Everything was perfect. The only thing is that it is a bit of a ways from the centre of town. But nice if you want peace and quiet, which is exactly what I was after.",5.0
After an exciting trip through the dessert we where overwhelmed by the warm welcome. This place is very beautiful and the interior is tasteful selected. the breakfast was the best during our vacation in Morocco. We stayed only one night but we will return.,5.0
"We stayed at this petit Riad for one night but was pleasantly surprised by its excellent service. As I have accidentally got a sprained ankle during the trip, I was quite worried but as soon as I arrived at this Riad, the staff were most helpful - they carried all my bags, gave me huge ice-cubes for my swollen ankle, made sure I could easily access the dining table for dinner and breakfast the next day. (And btw both the lemon spiced chicken tangine for dinner and Moroccan pancakes and fresh melon for breakfast were absolutely delicious!) I was immensely impressed by the kindness and friendly gestures of every staff in this Riad. No doubt I would give them more than 5 stars for the room cleanliness and cosiness, friendly service and great food.",5.0

"We stayed here very briefly after an excursion through the desert,so were most appreciative of the amenities and comfort (namely: the shower!).  The owner, Fatima, is lovely and friendly.  Our only small concern was our reception upon arriving - we were a bit travel-weary, and the individual who greeted us peppered us with quite a few questions and was a bit forceful about our having dinner at the riad, which we wished to do but could not manage the timing of.    All else was fantastic. The pool at the riad is gorgeous and the location is just far enough away from the city centre to be relaxing, yet easily accessible via a taxi or short walk. Although it's close to the airport, I wouldn't say that is necessarily a big draw in the end - as you need to take a taxi and it's flat…",4.0

"We booked through the owners website and after a bit of a mix up over price we sorted it out and are very happy here. At first glance it looks like many of the new houses built alongside the airport runway but with views of the mountains, a superb interior design and unique Moroccan style it is outstanding. From the street where you can park, you walk into a beautiful courtyard then into the main room which has stunning interior work. From there you are welcomed with a glass of mint tea and biscuits y the small nut lovely pool. Our room was amazing with a terrace overlooking the Atlas Mountains. We would thoroughly recommend this riad and like to thank Fatima, her staff and especially the chef. The chicken tagine we had was one of the very best we have ever eaten.",5.0

The room was spacious, bed super-comfortable, a lovely bathroom with quality toiletries. The terraced pool area has several areas for relaxation and the pool was refreshing.

What we loved best though was the attention to detail. The rooms are packed full of local art and decoration, the quality of the towels were fluffy and smelled delightful. The shampoos and soaps were amazing as well. There were even bathroom slippers and house slippers made available to us. The pool was not only beautiful and refreshing, but she also had a pool towel, straw hat, and straw fan available for every guest. We had both dinner and breakfast there and were never disappointed. The rooms also had AC and TV. You’ll love it!",5.0
"First I must apologize for not writing this review sooner. I thought I had. I spent a week here in April 2016. All of the members of the staff were simply fantastic. They were helpful, knowledgeable and truly made me feel like a member of the family. My flight into Ouarzazate was very late. They didn't have any rooms for the night here, so they arranged a room at one of their sister hotels and had a driver bring over to the Petit Riad in the morning after breakfast. They were in the process of upgrading their wifi and because my room was out of range, they even let me take the router to my room rah night. The food was amazing. I had never had most of the dishes and I thoroughly enjoyed all of them. They learned quickly that I was a fan of their mint tea so each morning and…",5.0
"We stayed here late last year on our way through Morocco; it was excellent! The owners (I believe a husband and wife) were absolutely lovely people. The dinners at the riad were warm and welcoming after a long journey. In the morning we had breakfast on the patio with the pool. While it was freezing outside, the grounds were stunning and it was worth the cold to have a meal on the patio in the sun.  The room was a queen bed with cable tv (most russian) and we had out own bathroom with a stand up shower on the first floor. We were tired after our journeys but it appeared to have board games in the main lobby/dining area. We arrived at night so could not see the mountains across the highway that were covered in snow; be sure to look in the morning! Highy recommend.",5.0

We spent 1 night at Le Petit Riad on our trip from Marrakech to Zagora. And were very positively surprised. Beautifully decorated and spacy rooms with an air of peace and warmth.

"This is a very cute, small hotel, which is reasonably priced. There is a nice patio out front and in back with small pool. The main entry/dining room is very interesting as well. We had an excellent dinner there one night (which must be ordered ahead). What makes this really nice is the warm and helpful owner and staff. They made us feel very welcome. The only complaint is the rooms are rather dark (we stayed into different ones coming and going from Zagora. And there is no closet pace or drawers to put your clothes. But for an overnight stay it is perfect.",4.0
"It's a lovely little riad near the airport. Each room is decorated in a delicate and unique way. Very clean and beautiful, and there's a nice little garden with a swimming pool.

We were even picked up at a gas station close by when we could not find our way and had to phone... The rooms, the house, terrace and garden are beautiful, the food is excellent.

"We arrived at Le Petit Riad after a long day of travelling along the Valley of the Kasbahs to be given a wonderful welcome at the door. We were delighted with the traditional style entrance hall and rooms, which combined a sense of space and peace with modern conveniences such as air-conditioning and wifi. It was lovely to sit and relax by the pool, as the sun went down, while we waited for dinner to be served at the pool-side. That was one of the best Moroccan home-made meals we had during our trip, and was followed the next morning by an amazing breakfast. I can recommend the Riad as a great stopping-off point, or as a base to explore the amazing scenery in the region.",5.0
"Greeted by the charming hotel owners and given fresh mint tea and homemade biscuits.   A lovely, tastefully decorated clean room, cool in the evening with air conditioning.

"Sadly I only spent one night there and that was very frustrating!  I was travelling around Morocco on a motorbike and had planned a one-night stop in Ouarzazate. Though I arrived late, the staff was very accommodating, helping me with my bike and making sure it was safely parked inside; that's merely an example. I was then served a fantastic tajine. The room was really cosy and comfortable, decoration is well thought of, the riad itself is conveniently located in a quiet area (despite being by the airport!) and absolutely charming inside and outside. I was mostly pleased with Aimad's kindness, so thank you for your warm welcome and your help, I'll make sure I stop by a few days next time I come to Ouarzazate!",5.0
"We specifically requested to stay here as part of our 3 night desert safari. The riad was like an oasis. Decor and furnishings, etc, were beautiful! All the staff were genuinely friendly and helpful. Our room was gorgeous. Beds were very comfortable, so sleep quality was excellent. We did walk into the centre of the town from here, about a 30 minute walk, but it was so cheap to return by taxi. The riad was also quiet, we could not hear anything in our room. Our meals were excellent, and it was my partner's birthday on the night we stayed so they even emerged with a cake and sung ""Happy Bithday"" to him, also in Berber! A truly beautiful experience!",5.0
"We were really happy with our stay at Le Petit Riad. We only stayed for one night as a stop over driving from Marrakech to the desert, but we wished we could have extended our trip for a day to stay here longer. The location is great, super easy to find. Even though it's by the airport we didn't see or hear a single plane during our stay. The hosts were lovely and very friendly and the room was great. It was spacious, had a tv, a little sofa and the bathroom was very clean. We had no problems with hot water and were very grateful for the controllable ac/heater (it was very cold at the beginning of March!).

We arrived after a long bus ride from Agadir and from the first moment we felt like home. The riad itself has the best atmosphere i experienced, it is berber, moroccan, full of local artpieces.  The owner Fatima and the 2 gentlemen who helped her were super helpful, friendly, nice people.  The rooms are beautiful and spacious (okay, we did not want to dance tango) for 2 person, clean, neat.

Overall, the owner and staff were very welcoming and we had a cute room with a private outdoor terrace. The room had heat and AC, which was quiet enough to leave on at night.

"This hotel is built in a nice setting, which seems to have been a large home, not exactly in the format of a Riad, but with outside windows. The breakfast is excellent and the team will  go that extra mile in satisfying your needs. Dinner is also good as a more simple option, given Oarzazate has excellent restaurants. The rooms are not small, (over) decorated in local fashion. One shower was good, the otehr licked water to the bathroom floor. Internet was fine, although not too fast.

Le Petit Riad is situated at the edge of the town adjacent to the Airport.  However a taxi ride of 5 minutes or less takes you to the centre of the town and at very little expense.  It is located in an area that appears to be very quiet which helped to ensure we had a great nights sleep after a long bus journey.  The reception area is full of character and is traditionally decorated providing a lovely area in which we had our breakfast and dinner.   Similarly our room was really nicely decorated providing a lovely relaxing environment .  The room was also a good size and very clean.  The room we had was upstairs and had a door opening onto a terrace from which we had a great view of the snow topped mountains.  There was also an air conditioning unit which operated as a very…,5.0
"It was a nice experience to go to Le Petit Riad. The Riad is very charming both the common places with the super big pool and our own room. Nice hot showers specially comming from three days in the desert. Fatima, the owner, is a very kind person that really helps you with everything you need, which includes for instance phoning agencies.   Besides, we asked for the possibility of having dinner and it was too late to offer us a proper dinner, Fatima said. That happend at 17:30. We also heard that they offer the possibility to help them cooking but this has to be said before 16:00.   During winter, the common places are a lite bit cold and so was the room even with the heating on.   I recommend the place if you have a medium budget. I can also imagine that in other seasons than…",4.0
This beautiful riad is a quiet little oasis away from the centre. Although it only takes about 20 - 25 mins to walk there or a 5 min taxi.  The owners and staff are so friendly. We were greeted by big smiles and a box of chocolates and a beautiful room.   Throughout our stay they were so helpful and anything we asked was no problem to them.  The evening meal/dinner we had there was one of the best tasting dishes we have had in morocco.   We say thank you to petit riad for being amazing. We recommend this place 100%  Lloyd & Ana,5.0
"We (partner, nine-year-old child, and me) stayed in Le Petit Riad for two nights. Out of all the hotels we stayed in while travelling around Morocco, this was definitely our favourite. Friendly and helpful staff, really beautiful decoration, lovely amenities (pool, breakfast terrace, cosy restaurant), tasty food, and a breathtaking view of mountains from the roof. I have nothing at all negative to say about this. Excellent value for money, too.",5.0
"Having triumphed over the pass (from Marrakech) in deep snow it was a relief to arrive here. A warm welcome, charming quirky room, a delightful roof terrace and a view of snow capped mountains with mint tea started the whole stay on a high note. There are only a few rooms each one individual but with all the facilities you need. Remember this is really a bed and breakfast. However the ground floor area with the small garden and swimming pool is lovely. We had a very copious and enjoyable breakfast stting outside the following morning. When we were there the evenings were bitterly cold (despite being British I did not venture into the swimming pool!), bu the rooms were warm. The Riad is a simple 10 minutes walk from 'new' centre 5 minutes from impressive Kasbah. The centre is not…",5.0
"After a long days travel, starting from Merzouga at 9 a.m., we reached our destination for the night. This hotel, turned out to be fantastic, and well beyond our expectations. Our room on the first floor had a large terrace, where were able to relax with a bottle of wine, olives and the rising moon in complete privacy! The service was excellent, the room very comfortable, and the food very good. It was too cold to enjoy the pool, but this property is certainly a hidden gem in Ouarzazate.",5.0
"We enjoyed our brief stay here. We had a large triple room with an extra bed arranged to sleep 4. The room was comfortable and nicely decorated with a large bathroom in Moroccan tiles.  Breakfast was generous with breads , pancakes, yogurt, omelettes, with local accompaniments like olive oil, olives, honey and jams. It is served on a sunny terrace by the pool- there is also a roof terrace with a nice view of the Atlas Mountains. Everyone was friendly and helpful throughout our stay.   The riad is on the outskirts of town near the airport - a little bit hard to find so you might want to ask for directions.    This was a nice stopover for us on our trip and we'd definitely recommend it. ",5.0
"This delightful Riad was a really lovely place to stay.  The owner is friendly and helpful, and so are her staff, the decor is brilliant, each room is different and the place is full of their own art.  The gorgeous smell of the home-cooked food tempts you to eat in, and you won't be disappointed.  Full of character, but everything works! The only downside was the very loud call to prayer from the mosque next door.",5.0
"From the friendly welcome the moment you step through the door to the offer of a cold bottle of water as you leave this little riad is a wonderful oasis in the hot Moroccan desert. We visited in the height summer when temperatures were sizzling around the 45°C mark so the pool, air con and shady patio were most welcome. The evening meal was quite simply delicious, and breakfast was only slightly marred by the hungry wasps. Great place!",5.0
My wife and I stayed at the Le Petit Riad prior to starting a bicycle tour that started in Ouarzazate.  The Riad was very clean and well maintained.  The host Aimad was incredibly accommodating and did everything possible to make sure our stay there was fabulous.  I would highly recommend the Le Petit Riad.,5.0
"This is a nice riad with a very friendly team providing spot on service, and serving great food.  The lemon tajine I had on my first night was phenomenal.  Some wild décor (loved my pink bathroom) adds to the exotic feel.  Good pool and conveniently located to head out to the desert or to the route of the kasbahs.",5.0
"Le Petit Road was one of several we stayed in while traveling through Morocco, and it seems to be the one that comes up quite often when we recount our travels to friends. The location was nice, the staff was great and the room was nice. What really sealed the deal for us though, was the surprise local entertainment that showed up unexpectedly during dinner. (I honestly have no idea if this is a regular occurrence)  I was tired, and ready to crawl into be as I ate my last bite of dinner when out come some very enthusiastic Moroccan musicians. There were three tables of diners. My husband and I, a group of what we guessed were 4 German couples, and a family of 6 speaking French.

"A little difficult to find, as the GPS shows a location further down the street. It is actually opposite the landing area of the planes (but you won't hear any). The riad itself is nicely decorated, has a great atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. Breakfast is good, but while we were there the wifi was already offline for 4 days. The food is apparantly very good, but we arrived to late to enjoy that. The recommendations given by the staff for food outside of the Riad were also great!",4.0
"When we booked this placed, we didn't quite realise that it was almost 3km away from the city center. Petits taxis are fairly cheap in Ouarzazate but as two backpackers on a tight budget we would have preferred a more central location.   The place itself is extremely pretty and nice, you instantly feel welcome. The owner Fatima would move earth and skies to make sure you're alright. After two days in the desert our room was most appreciated.   We were asked if we were going to have dinner there and agreed as we were too tired to walk back to the city center. My partner absolutely loved the food, while I did not enjoy it as there was rose water in all three courses and I don't like it. We had a bad surprise at check-out: the meal was 12 euros per person!

Wonderful staff! The riad was gorgeous and full of beautiful art made by one of the owners. Was only going to stay 1 night but we loved it so much we added another.

Pros: - Staff was very helpful and friendly. Gave us directions, accommodating with requests, etc... - The food was outstanding (dinner and breakfast). Chicken Tagine! - A/C worked well. - Bathroom was best I've had in Morocco (literally felt like a home).  - Rooms were large and spacious.  - Pool area was nice (we had sheesha outside beside it).  - The decorations were really cool.   Cons: - Only con was that the Bees really loved the honey served for breakfast ;)",5.0
"The Riad is a super place, beautiful art hangs around all the walls and the bedroom was very comfortable with lots of cushions and throws. You hear the call to prayer from the Mosque nearby, the pool area is very private and it adds up to an atmospheric location, Dinner was really excellent, proper Moroccan cooking...fantastic flavours and served with style. However, the best aspect of our stay was the excellent welcome and hospitality from the staff, nothing was too much trouble. Well worth a visit!",5.0
"The riad is located in front of the airport, it has a nice swimming pool area and the staff is friendly. We stayed in the room near the pool which was kind of dark and the shower is not very comfortable. It is a good place to stay but it lacks of the typical riad atmosphere.",3.0

Stayed here for a night on our way from Marrakech to Merzouga.  Great little place to stay and furnished really nicely.  Lovely pool area.  The meal in the evening was superb.

If you guys read this..that Aubergine dish...I do not know how you guys did it, but it was amazing! The room was great, spacious. If it had been a little warmed I would have dived into that pool! Excellent place to get our stuff together and get a little pampered before our desert adventure. Love it!",5.0
Four of us stayed for seven nights and were totally charmed by the owner Fatima and her lovely staff. We ate mainly in the hotel and were presented with delightful traditional food. The staff could not be more helpful providing assistance with booking taxis and tours. They also arranged taxi transport from Marrakech Airport. Altogether a brilliant little outfit! ,5.0

The communal areas are also beautiful, with comfortable furnishings and lovely knickknacks and fantastic art work, (done by one of the owners).   We met Fatima but not her husband the artist.  Fatima and her staff gave us a very warm welcome to the Riad, mint tea and biscuits was quickly arranged out by the pool, which was lovely.  Dinner both nights was fantastic.  At least 3 courses, all very well cooked and presented.  The amount was plentiful, but the flavours kept you wanting more!  We just wanted to relax after being in the desert, and some days of long drives, so lounged by the pool, but Fatima and her…",5.0
We had a lovely spacious room and decent bathroom at this Riad.  The staff were wonderful - they helped us with our day trips and organising our onward travel options.  The were quick to serve us mint tea and cookies and did our laundry.

The food was excellent - we stayed for 3 nights and had a wonderful meal every night!,4.0
"The staff at this little riad made us feel right at home. The decor was awesome and the beds were very comfortable, but really it was the staff that made it an experience to remember. The woman who cooked for us (I think her name was Maria) spoke perfect Spanish, French, and Arabic and her english was quite good too though she'd tell you otherwise. She came out to talk with us, and not just for a second but for a real conversation, and indulged my broken French. Her food was amazing (tajine of course) and I regret not being able to spend more time there. If I ever make it back to Ouarzazate I'm definitely staying here.",5.0

They arranged an airport pickup for us, gave us a gracious welcome with mint tea and cookies  by the pool, a lovely room with a private outdoor sitting room, and a delicious breakfast. We also had dinner there and it was probably one of the three best dinners we had in our 10 day visit to Morocco. It is very near the sirpory, but only a short taxi ride into the main town. Thank you do much.",5.0
We stayed at this Riad for one night as a half-way stop between Marrakech and m'Hamid (the desert). We wanted to alter our reservation at the very last minute to a different  day and were able to do this with no problem at all. Our room was clean and comfortable with a lovely big bed and large en suite bathroom/ wet room.  Dinner was delicious- freshly prepared traditional Moroccan food.  This Riad is lovely and peaceful- a perfect place for us to recharge prior to a trip to the desert.,5.0

We chatted with her as we enjoyed our mint tea in the courtyard by the pool upon arrival. The breakfast was delicious and it was very relaxing to enjoy it by the pool in the morning. Our room was on the second floor and was beautifully decorated. The bathroom and room were both spacious. A large terrace on the second floor provided an area to enjoy the outdoors.

"I saw many reviews and believed that it would be a very good stay. In fact, the dinner there is amazing (I dare saying the best I had in Morocco). But we had problems with hot shower and the owner arranged us a driver that did not speak English, although we have asked that. Despite the fact that we showed our dissatisfaction with this situation in the very first day, she only showed concern when we Ieft and they arranged an English speaker guide to take us to Marrakesh (totally unnecessary).  One point, the staff is really, really kind and sweet.  The room is simple, but one can live with that. To sum up it is a good price for the room and again, for the dinner, really outstanding. I recommend, but knowing that it will be a simple stay and you may face some problems.",3.0
We stayed at the Le Petit Riad for three nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The staff were very friendly and always went out of their way to help out.  We had an early start (2:30am) one morning but had breakfast prepared before our departure.  They were also great at organising taxis for us to go to and from places of interest.  The Riad doesn't have a set menu but they do provide food which was another highlight.  The chicken skewers were absolutely delicious.  It's a bit of a walk to get to the main medina but that's a minor inconvenience.  I'd highly recommend this as a place to stay.,5.0

The rooms were roomy and comfortable and the breakfast near the pool was excellent as well. When we left, we were given a bottle of water for on the road. The perfect place, highly recommended !!

After a week in the Draa valley we decided to come back and spend another night. The riad is near the airport, but we never saw an airplane taking off or landing, so this was not an issue. The place is within walking distance from the old town (15 minutes walk), so, event if the district is modern, there is plenty to see not too far away.

Everyday she cooks with fresh ingredients and nothing goes into the fridge for later meals: leftovers are given away.

"We spent 3 nights in the Petit Riad in Ouarzazate in Oct 2011 and absolutely loved it. The location of the riad is the downside, as it is a good 25 mins walk from the city centre. Besides, it is also located to an airport. There is very little air traffic at night (almost none) but when a plane lands or takes off, you can hear it more than clearly!! However, those downsides are outweighed by the pros. The place is very cosy and superbly decorated, from the entrance hall to the rooms, the presence of a lovely swimming pool is a plus, and Fatima and her team are more than helpful.

If we come to Ouarzazate again, we surely visit Le Petit Riad !!",5.0
"Wonderful experience staying in riad.Fatima was a wonderful host and the staff are very friendly and helpful.We had two evening meals there by the pool  which were very enjoyable and home cooked , our best meals in Morocco.Would suggest booking in for for dinner as the restaurants are too far to walk.Would have liked to stay longer and enjoy the setting.",5.0

"Encouraged by the positive reports on trip-advisor, we stayed 2 nights in ""Le  Petit Riad"" on our way to the desert in M'Hamid and another 2 nights on our return before visiting the Dadès Gorge.  We can certainly confirm all the positive reports: Fatima and Jamel were very helpful and friendly hosts. The meals were delicious, the rooms charmingly decorated and clean and the swimming pool very welcome after a long day's driving/sight-seeing. Ouarzazate is well-situated to visit Ait Ben Hadou, The Draa valley and the Dadès Gorge and we were extremely satisfied with the standards offered in ""Le Petit Riad"".",5.0
"10 of us with 10 motorbikes stayed here for one night in early May.   Absolutely beautiful guesthouse - entrance area with lovely decoration and artworks (the owner is an artist), small but gorgeous swimming pool area with amazingly vivid colourful flowers everywhere.  The food was terrific, probably the best tasting we had in 2 weeks in Morocco.  The owner hardly speaks any english, but the guy who works there (sorry can't remember his name) is pretty good.  He is so friendly and helpful - nothing is a problem and you are really made feel welcome here in their home.  We did not explore the town so can't say how good the location is, apart from the fact being beside the (very quiet) airport it is really easy to find.  Watch out for the loud call to prayers at around 5 am.",5.0
The owner and staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly. We always looked forward to breakfast in the poolside garden.,5.0
"Fatima and her staff out-did them selves and her amazing villa ""La Petit Riad"".  The food was out of this world; incredible staff; and the villa itself was a slice of heaven!~   There were four of us (two couples and a 1 yr old baby) and it was a relaxing retreat that would make couples, friends, families or individual travelers feel right at home.    I can't say enough about our stay here, and would highly recommend it to everyone.    Merci, Fatima!",5.0
"This excellent newish riad can be a little hard to find although it is not far from the city centre.  Look up the location before you go as taxi drivers don't always know the address. The rooms are large and comfortable, the beds excellent and the bathrooms match this.  Breakfast on the terrace by the pool is a real luxury especially as the food is so good.  Evening meals are highly recommended - excellent cooking of local dishes at a very reasonable cost.  Fatima is a great host and her staff could not be more helpful.  If you want a car to rent, all can be arranged very easily and for much less than you might pay if doing it yourself.  Don't miss this opportunity if in Ouarzazarte!",5.0
"I spent a week in the riad that we booked entirely with a group friends. Time to relax, feel the perfume of morocco, and enjoy its culture and generosity. I travelled to quite few places on earth, but this will remain as one of my best memory. The riad is well decorated, the room are charmfull, and Fatima and her team are moren than nice, they act and behave as your best friends.",5.0

"This is a very hospitable and comfortable place to stay.  It is more properly described as a small hotel or bed and breakfast because it does not have a central courtyard that is open to the sky.  It has a great swimming pool and terrace area.  The pool was of little use to us in January, but breakfast on the terrace was nice ... homemade breads, including great croissants.  Our dinner there was also very good.  The staff speaks very little English.  Spanish or French language skills would be a big plus for guests to have.  It is quiet there, except for the calls to prayer in the mosque next door that start before 6:00 am, but that is an issue everywhere in Morocco.  The riad is in a new building in a new residential neighborhood in Ouarzazate.  In fact, most of Ouarzazate looks…",4.0
"Le Petit Riad is located away from the town centre near the airport so if you want to explore and don't have a car this might not be the best choice for you. We did have a car so it was great. Our room was on the ground floor and was very large, decorated green and orange with a vintage lamp and phone and a king size bed which was very comfortable. Our faucet in the bathroom also broke on arrival but was fixed within the hour (i saw that someone else had written they had the same problem with this room!) Breakfasts were the best we had on our stay in Morocco and dinner was also very good. The pool was nice and the staff were very pleasant.",4.0

"My husband and I stayed for one night as a stopover between the gorges and Marrakech. We received a very warm welcome and some hot mint tea upon arrival. The room was one of the better ones we had during our 10 day trip in Morocco - well decorated, spacious, clean, with soft towels and linens and enough hot water. The breakfasts and dinners were also very good, although the portions were so huge, not even a family of 5 could have finished our tagine! The pool area is lovely, with lots of flowers and reclining beach chairs where you can read or get some sun. The staff were very kind and attentive during our stay, and, when the faucet in our bathroom broke soon after we arrived, they got someone to fix it within an hour while we relaxed by the pool, so they handled this very well…",5.0
"I was disappointed here, not with the place itself but with the food. When I booked I switched from a budget option to this Riad because our contact at Blue Men mentioned that her clients rave about the food. And, in fact, people we met in Todra had raved about the food here. But in our experience, it was below average. We had had really wonderful tagines at even the most touristy places but here they were not up to that caliber. So that was a let down. Otherwise, this riad is lovely; a pretty little place in a residential area (not suited to walking anywhere, which was fine by us since it was really windy the day we were there). The room was nicely decorated. Another place where the water wasn’t hot enough for a shower, though.",4.0
"Imagine staying at somebody's house in Modern Morocco, that is how I would describe staying at Le Petit Riad. We stayed for one night and thought that the place looked very nice and the swimming pool area looked inviting. The food was decent, but there didn't seem to be any other places close by to eat as it was in a residential neighborhood.  The place was quiet whenever a plane was not about to land. Unfortunately, the location is across the street from the airport in Ouarzazate. Luckily, we only heard one plane during our overnight stay.  One other complaint, we had trouble locking and unlocking our door with the key.",3.0

"We stayed at this delightful hotel as we were intrigued by the movie theme of the hotel and we were not disappointed.  If you want to step into Hollywood in Morocco , then this is your hotel!  We stayed  in the Cleopatra Suite.  The attention to detail is spot on. What we liked about the hotel was the personal touch. The impeccable service started the second we walked through the door. Omar the general manager was very helpful. His hospitality went above and beyond.  It’s a pity there isn’t a Jewel In the Crown room as Omar would certainly deserve his place there. The owner of the hotel is a film producer and we loved how he channelled his creativity in making this hotel a homage of the Hollywood films that were made in Morocco.  Has to be seen.",5.0
"Nous habitons le Maroc depuis quelques années et avons passé les vacances dans le Sud du pays.  Nous y avons trouvé une région désertée par les touristes, vacante, ruinée.   Pour l'hôtel à Ouarza, on craignait le pire. Tout était fermé, boutiques barricadées, sites déserts, dunes sans traces, chameaux absents.,.. Nous n'avions rien réservé, échaudés par ces sites qui débitent votre carte de crédit, confirment votre réservation et ne vous disent pas, mauvaise surprise, que l'établissement est fermé depuis deux semaines. Au Temple, nous étions seuls, ma femme et moi.  C""était le soir d'un 31 décembre qui s'annonçait Coronasinistre. Deux messieurs ""très comme-il-faut"" aurait diit ma grand-mère nous ont accueillis dans les règles (thé, amuse-bouches immédiats), installés dans la meilleure suite comme les nababs que nous aimerions être, et suivis de leurs courtoises attentions.  Un détail dira tout :  nous avions emporté (c'était quand même le Nouvel An!) une bouteille de champagne.  Ils nous l'ont gracieusement frappée à coeur, servie dans la chambre dans un seau avec son linge blanc et ont rempli les coupes selon le grand protocole.   Essayez ça au Marriott ou à l'Intercon !!  Sans doute ont-ils dû, un soir pareil et seulement pour un couple, réveiller le chef, réputé ici, et relancer sa cuisine. Toujours est-il que nous avons mangé un repas tout simple et extrêmement raffiné. (Briouates et côtelettes d'agneau. Je connais beaucoup d'agneaux de Sisteron à Saint-Rémy-de-Provence mais on ne m'avait pas encore fait la surprise de m'en cuire les côtelettes comme ce monsieur.)  Tout le reste, oui, oui, l'hôtel est irréprochable. Au-dessus des choses mesurables en étoiles, on trouve au Temple ce genre d'hospitalité qui donne envie, non pas de revenir, mais de rester.…",5.0
"Check-in: arrived late and tired.  We were greeted at the door with a warm welcome.  We were invited to sit while the receptionist completed the registration.  While we were waiting we were presented with dinner menus.  We were asked to select our meal and give them a time when we wanted to eat.  Now that's service.  Room: The room is gorgeous.  We were given an upgraded room.  Each room in the hotel is based on a movie filmed in town.  Our room was Kundun so the decor was designed to look like a Buddhist temple.  The room was large with a sitting area, fireplace! And another small sleeping area.  Would be perfect for a couple travelling with a child.  The bathroom is large with a massive tub and double sinks.  The room also had a balcony facing the pool.  There are 2 mosques quite close to the hotel so we could clearly hear the call to prayer.  A shame we were only there overnight.  Restaurant: We had the restaurant to ourselves for dinner and breakfast.  Dinner was ordered in advance during check in.  So we sat down and were served almost immediately.  We had salads to start.  My husband had a Berber salad – tomatoes, onions and peppers.  My mother and I had a trio of salads – beet, carrot and tomato.  The salads were served in adorable mini tagines. For our main courses, my mother and I had brochettes – lamb, chicken and kofta while my husband had a chicken tagine with preserved lemons.  We all had crepes suzette for dinner.  Everything was delicious, the service was attentive.  The ambiance in the restaurant is cozy.  There are four or five tables and a fireplace.  Breakfast the next morning was also good with the same attentive service.  Overall Service:  Service at the hotel is excellent.  Check in was quick, and dinner ordered during check in was welcome after a long day.  We had trouble with our room safe that was fixed promptly.  At one point, my mother was having trouble locking her room. The front desk clerk heard her struggling with the key and came upstairs right away to help before even being called.  After dinner, we walked around the hotel to check out the decor.  It is decorated like an Egyptian temple.  As we  were walking around one of the staff members opened up some of the areas to show us around.  Only good things to say about this place!…",5.0
"Lovely hotel with beautiful decor. We stayed in the Kundun suite. Wonderful room. We had great service from staff, including Jawad at the desk and Omar as waiter. The meal was very good.

"We spent one night at the Temple des Artes in Ouazazate.  A unique and beautiful hotel inspired by the history of movies in the area and the local film studios.  We stayed in the Lawrence of Arabia suite, which was spacious and beautifully decorated.  The staff were wonderful and arranged our taxi to visit Ait Ben Haddou – highly recommended at sunrise or sunset for fewer crowds and spectacular photography.  Due to our late arrival ad early departure we had little time to explore the hotel further, but the gardens and pool looked wonderful.  We had one meal from room-service and this was freshly prepared and very tasty.",5.0
"The property is beautifully decorated, laid out and furnished.  The downsides to this place is that....it literally stinks.  The smell comes at you inside and out, coming and going, It's basically the sewer smell you get when you're too close to it.  The other downsides are that the staff, although compliant, are not very swift.  Orders need to be repeated, and if they can't do something, rather than disappoint you, they'll just ignore you.  One other downside, and I can only speak for the Kundun suite, is that, even though they have a separate bedroom so that 3 people can stay in the suite, there's only one bathroom.  It's a definite shortcoming.  The food is adequate, but nothing to brag about.  It should be a little better based on the pricing for this location.  One other little bomb, (sorry) is that we absolutely had to do laundry as we were out.  One load cost $80 US dollars.  Yes, $80(eighty).  US. Dollars.  Ah, travel.…",3.0

"We had 1 night here as a stopover. It was a welcome oasis of calm. A small hotel with only 7 rooms. Each named after a movie that was made in the area. We stayed in the Gladiator room, it had nice furnishings and was roomy, a bonus was that we could make a tea and coffee in our room if we wanted to, which we did. Dinner was included in our price which was very nice. I didn’t like the icing sugar dusted over my pastille for dinner it put me off. We had some nice wine and were grateful that they served it as we were here in Ramadan. They’re was a nice room with music which we enjoyed using when we had the wine while using the WIFI.  The negatives, the shower which was pretty useless with a hand held hose with very low water pressure. The staff (2) were very polite but seemed amateurish and not shown real professionalism. We have no complaint about them as it was situational. It’s a nice place to stay. Also there was a pool with not much care with the gardens around it. …",4.0

"We stayed here for 2 nights and were not disappointed. The room we stayed in was the  ""Gladiator"" suite. The room was well decorated, but the in room lighting was a bit ""weak"" through the daytime hours as there are no windows and as such no natural light. Having said that, we would stay here again should we be back to Ouarzazate.  The hotel lobby is very well appointed and the breakfast was very good. The staff were very friendly and attentive to our needs and questions. We were not able to use the pool as it was overcast and rainy when we were there, but it looked very nice.",4.0

However, the porch that is outside is currently facing a noisy street and the pool. Upon arrival, they asked us if we wanted to have dinner at the restaurant in the hotel which only had five or so tables. We eventually decided to eat at the restaurant because we were so tired.

There was a leak under the sink, which they fixed the second day. The shower had no curtain and no real shower rose - just a handheld nozzle that sprayed water everywhere - and no handrails, making it tricky to get in and out of the tub since it had steps up and down. Breakfast was mostly bread products, although eggs were available. Staff tried to be helpful but didn't seem especially well trained or knowledgable (e.g., they couldn't transfer an incoming call to our friend's room since only one staff member knew how to do this and wasn't there).

"This was the only hotel that ripped us off during our 10 day 4 or 5 star stay all across Morocco. I know they were desperate for money because there was only one other suite occupied, we were the only ones who ate dinner and the entire hotel - including our room - was freezing cold and not heated but it doesn't excuse the rip-off behaviour.   The staff was excellent - especially our restaurant server who came in earlier the next day to give us breakfast a little early - but they were obviously being bullied by the owner.

My only fault of this hotel is that the daily menu don't differ much and the choice of selection in what you can eat is not massive , but that seem to be a morocon  thing on the whole. ",4.0

"Our room at this hotel was very nicely appointed and spacious, but the AC didn't work well so our room was hot. They could not provide us with any ice for our room, and when we were at the pool, the porter didn't understand when I tried to order a glass of white wine. The service was difficult because of the language barrier. The pool area was shoddy and unkept and the pool was too freezing to use. Our lights went out in the bathroom so we lost precious time in the morning not being able to get ready to leave because our bathroom was dark.  It's a shame our experience was rather unsavory because the hotel itself is nice and has great potential. ",3.0

Absolutely clean in all areas  In summary a place not to be missed!",5.0
This is a phenomenal boutique hotel in Ourzazate very close by car to Atlas Studios.  The hotel has rooms that are themed after movies that have been filmed in the region.  Our suite (Kundun) was immaculate and had modern amenities//it had the Tibetan theme running through the furniture and decorations.  We had 2 terraces--one overlooked the pool on the ground floor.  We had both dinner and breakfast at the hotel.  The food and service were outstanding.  We highly recommend a stay at Themis hotel if you are transiting to/from the Sahara desert to Marrakech.,5.0
"I staid one night in this wonderful and unique ""Morocco Meets Hollywood"" hotel as I wanted absolutely to discover the Ait Ben Haddou Kasba, and I must say it was an incredible and unforgettable experience!   The Hotel Temple des Arts has only 7 rooms and suites, and they were all unique in their conception and their decoration, so I was really excited to discover this place!  In fact, I never staid in such a small and private hotel but very soon I realized it was the perfect choice!  We arrived extremely late as we drove from Fez (which took 8h driving) and arrived around 1 AM at the Hotel. However the staff was very friendly and helped us straight away with our luggage.

We spoke to the receptionist who checked the room, admitted that there was indeed a smell, and tried to mask it with a deo spray. But the sewage odor was too strong, and the spray didn't have any effect. The receptionist told us that no other rooms were available. Then he called the manager. The manager started with explaining that the smell was from outside and he couldn't do anything about it, it was in all the rooms. He suggested we either turn off the AC or burn a candle. I'm allergic so the candle option was a no-go. And it was too hot without AC. So we asked if we could just leave and find another place. He shouted at me in the lobby, threatened to call the cops, and refused to let us leave. To top all…",2.0
After our night in the desert we were warmly welcomed with mint tea and the co-owner Albert was delightfully chatty and friendly.

We slept for instance in the Lawrence of Arabia room. They will show you around even if you don't want to.  There is a nice garden and a BIG swimming pool.  The staff is nice, maybe a bit over the top.  We had two days an excellent breakfast in the garden.  One day we had dinner there but the meal was rather heavy while we a are used to light meals.  A bit disappointing was that they used a bad rate when we left. Not good for the price of the hotel (320 euro for 2 nights)",4.0

The beds were not a soft/comfortable as i would like but beds in general are firmer in Morocco. The service after the check in could have been improved but this is a new place and they are still getting it right.

From the moment we arrived we knew we were about to enjoy something special.   This luxury 'guest house' has just seven rooms and suites, each decorated thematically on a movie .

The very warm welcome from Ibrahim and Albert turned our miserable faces into a big smile. The guesthouse and it's seven rooms are beautifully decorated, clean and the entire interior is of outstanding quality. Location is great (and safe) and also the hammam in the guest house was a perfect distraction after a day of solid rain.

We drove up to this beautiful walled hotel and right away we knew we were somewhere special.  The public spaces and the pool were very pretty.  It had a very comfortable welcoming atmosphere.  We received excellent service---the staff could not do enough to help us.   The hotel did not look like the usual luxury hotel--it was more like a fun and interesting place and they carried the theme of Hollywood throughout the property.  There are only 7 rooms so it really does give you the feeling that all the beauty is just for you!!  We had an enjoyable meal in the 2nd floor dining room. My only comment about this was that the dining room itself did not have the character and beauty of all the other public spaces.  And--I wish they had a luggage rack in the room.

I found this hotel to be more tacky than kitch, the service is fine but not fantastic and breakfast was average. It was not worth the price we paid.  We also had problems with the air conditioning in our room (we were in the Gladiator suite). It simply did not cool the room. The guy from the hotel we told was surprisingly unhelpful.

There is a parking place a couple of minutes away in case you have a car. Clearly the best part of Ouarzazate easily missed if you storm through the city on your way to the desert.   Nathalie and Aziz are great hosts, eager to help and provide tips and information.   We only stayed a night but had a great time.",5.0
"Dar El Nath is a lovely modern riad in a very old area of Ouarzazate, right by the Kasbah Taorite.  The rooms are clean, fresh, well appointed, and so comfortable. The hosts, Aziz  and Nathalie are very friendly, welcoming and extremely helpful, eg.  we asked about prices we should pay in the souks for a couple of things and their guidance was so useful. We felt that we left as friends and would definitely love to get back to stay with them.",5.0
"We stopped here in Ouarzazate for 1 night en route to the desert, expecting very little of the town.  In fact, although this place is not near the town centre it is a gem, in a fascinating and historical area. It is such a pity that many tourists will miss this, which is easily the best part of Ouarzazate.   It is a lovely house, but the owners are fantastic.  They did everything to make our stay a real pleasure.  This is highly recommended.",5.0
"My husband and I had a wonderful time staying with Aziz and Nathalie in their modern, clean and bright home for 3 nights in Ouarzazate.  The Riad wasn't too difficult to find.  We parked our car in the free parking lot just inside the medina and for a small tip, a local took us there. The couple were friendly and very helpful.  Aziz helped us to book an overnight camp in the desert, booked us a very nice riad with great value in Fes, suggested us where to go for our day trip, and help us to plan the itinerary of our Moroccan tour.  When our car tire was intentionally deflated in another touristy attraction, they told us to return and Nathalie took us to fix our tire.  One night they were so genuinely concerned for us and made several phone calls to locate us  when we returned…",5.0
"Dar El Nath is a beautiful Riad in Middle of Ouarzazate (but in a qiet side road so there is no noise at all). The owner Aziz and Nathalie are a very friendly, lovely and fun couple who planned everything and did take great care of us. The food was great, we got a huge barber Couscous at one night and enjoyed sitting, talking and dancing in the living area.  The room was excellent. We got a very comfortable room with a nice bathroom in it. It was very clean and we felt almost like home. We explicity recommend this lovely Riad and would love to come back one day. Thank you both for making our stay so amazing :)",5.0
"Dar el Nath is a lovely guest house situated in a kasbah (old city center). It's very clean, pretty new and well maintained. The owners are a French-Moroccan couple Nathalie and Aziz: they not only acommodate you, but give you great tips on restaurants, food, sightseeing or whatever you ask for. We were even offered to dine with them a few times - meals provided by locals, great berber pencakes, tajines, yoghurts, etc... Aziz helped us to rent a car for a very good price and even when some problems occured with the guy who rented a car, Aziz put enormous efforts at 10 pm to sort everything out (thanks Aziz!!!).

The rooms are beautiful and nicely decorated, and the indoor patio and terrasse are great places to eat and chill after a long day of hiking in the beautiful area.

We were shown different rooms to choose from and all were elegantly designed with a selection of great literature books, soft bedding and authentic styling. The price quality ratio is incredible.   As for constructive criticism, it would be nitpicking on the   details. Clothing hangers for in the closet, iron and ironboard, a bottle of water in the rooms would be highly appreciated.

"The Khris Palace is a nice Aparthotel, close to the airport, in a area that looks not so nice but absolutely safe. The room we stayed was at the last floor, and it looked like a berber tent. The room was very comfortable, the bed very good, enough space for everything and also a kitchen. Bathroom included 2 bathsuites. Finally the breakfast is very good and served in room with an housemaid that comes to cook it in the kitchen. The only problem was the credit card: despite they say they accept it unfortunately it didnt was operational. Impossible to know if it was just an excuse or a real problem. If you want to stay at the Khris Palace it is ok but as in other parts of the south of Morocco bring with you enough cash!",4.0

A few negatives... -The card machine was broken so we had to waste time looking for an ATM the nearest one was out of town so not very convenient and we were tired.  -Someone in the apartment above was dragging furniture around above the double bedroom for several hours in the dead of night...not what you fancy after a 6 hour drive. Relocating to the twin bedroom was fine for a while but as the wind picked up slightly, we realised that there was plastic sheeting holding the windows together which rustled loudly.    -wifi refused to work despite the owner making several attempts to fix it   Breakfast was served early morning by a housekeeper which was a lovely touch.

In the morning two people came to serve the breakfast in our dining area, after preparing it in our own kitchen.

Breakfast in the flat is great and we also really enjoyed the free laundry service. We would definitely recommend this place but would suggest the Kris Palace team to fix the copper shower which is spraying all over the bathroom.

"I just spent 5 nights at this lovely hotel. It’s the perfect place to relax and a good base for exploring the area.  I particularly liked the large garden with fruits, flowers and herbs, where care was taken to create little areas to sit and rest, talk, swing in a hammock, read a book… it’s really special. The swimming pool was also in a lovely location, in a dedicated corner of the garden, with sun loungers and towels, so you feel you have relative privacy and can really relax. The water was not chlorinated and seemed pretty clean (and very refreshing after some time in the sun). There are not that many rooms so you have a lot of space to enjoy the place. It seemed popular with young couples.  The other part that is great about this particular Kasbah (and there are so many in and around Skoura) is the staff. Lahcine, in particular, was excellent. I was so surprised when he called me as soon as I placed my reservation online, to check what time I was arriving, and whether I need a lift from the bus/taxi stop (in English!). And since then he was both professional and extremely helpful with local information and organizing whatever I asked for, without ever once crossing the line. The staff are super nice, but never intrusive, and mostly you just feel you have the place to yourself. You can really feel at home here. If you choose to dine in, they check with you what you would like to eat for dinner, and go out of your way to accommodate your preferences. Delicious breakfast is served in a shaded part of the garden: what a way to start your day!  I also liked the unobtrusive décor / colour scheme of the place. The Kasbah rooms and their bathrooms are simple and a little on the small side, but there are bigger rooms for families in another part of the garden.  Areas for improvement: Would be nice to have better wifi and somewhere to put your clothes (shelves/wardrobe/hangers) in the room.   If you come to Skoura, don’t miss the Monday morning souk!

"We are an Australian family (two adult and two kids, age 8 and 10). We stayed a couple nights at this Kasbah in September 2013. It's a great place. Other reviews have described it as an oasis within an oasis, and that's a pretty good description. It is very peaceful, with beautiful grounds and gardens, a wonderful pool, relaxing courtyards and outdoor sitting areas, and a great, quiet vibe. The small staff is friendly and prepares reasonably good food.   The rooms are very simple, but excellent value for the money (the staff actually allowed us the use of an additional room for no charge- very kind).The rooms definitely need some TLC though- they're a little rundown (eg broken fixtures, burnt out lights, furniture falling apart, etc), but nothing major, and the whole place is generally tastefully decorated. Given the reasonable cost, and the attractive grounds and gardens, we were quite satisfied, and actually planned to stay on extra nights to enjoy the serenity. However...  There was just one problem when we stayed there- biting bugs in the beds. Our kids first reported feeling bites on their arms and legs while in bed. At first we thought they were imagining it. Then we felt them too, By the end of the second night, we had to cut our stay short (we actually fled our beds in the middle of the second night and slept on self-inflating mattresses on the floor!). Our legs and arms were absolutely covered in bites, and getting very itchy.   btw...we did investigate and think we found the source of the problem. The hotel had allowed the top floor rooms to fall into disrepair. Birds had taken up residence in some old mattresses up there, and there were bird droppings everywhere, particularly above the two rooms we rented. It was probably bird lice from them (there were feathers on our beds when we arrived and we did not understand until later where they came from). Anyway, it was a real shame because we had enjoyed the place thoroughly and did want to leave, but had too. They need to address this immediately, and do some basic repairs of the place, and they would have a real winner.…",3.0

Beds are comfy and you will get real white linnen ... what a difference to other places in Marroco. Not all rooms are used all times (some small signs of neglection). Some rooms have little smell from the pipes (but that might be weather related). The diningroom is the inside court of the Kasbah ... nice (maybe noise in the rooms with many guests - we've been the only guests). Dinner was tasteful and a big portion. Breakfast (okay) was at an outside terrace. Nice garden with a big clean pool (chairs and shadow). The host and staff are very friendly and service orientated. All in all a good Place to stay ... and have a relaxing day. Many palms of Skoura look very ill and at most parts don't stay close together. So we suggest to choose other places to visit a Palmerie.

I can also recommend the dinner! The staff was exceptionally friendly, the mandatory mint tea was served upon arrival and a ride to the center of the village was offered upon departure. The Kasbah is situated some 1,5km from the village center and quite easy to find. The garden around the house with chairs to relax make it an ideal place for families to stay.",5.0

I can strongly recommend to stay here.,5.0
"We did not stay here, but our guide recommended this place for an authentic Berber lunch. If you are going to Ait-BenHaddou, stop here for lunch.  We had the best Beef couscous that we had throughout the trip, even better than the one we had at Royal Mansour.   We are still dreaming of that lunch. It's the best and cheapest (which is even better) meal we had throughout our whole trip. ",5.0
We had a very delicious Tagline lunch. It really was the best Tagline we ever had. We did not stay here only lunch. We were on a 6 day private tour of Morocco and we're taken here by the tour operator.,5.0

"We had a very relaxing stay at Amzil and was well looked after by the host and his family. It was the best Tagine we had during our stay in Morocco. The rooms were clean and had a cosy area where you could really wind down. The walls are decorated with collected memorabilia from various film sets. We also had cookery lesson. My wife and my little daughter also did henna which were lovely. If you like something different to a normal hotel stay, then would definitely recommend this place.",5.0
"I had a lovely stay for a nice with the lovely Amzil family. Plenty of activities were organized for me: a tour of the village with the 14 year old Adnane, cooking class with Nora and a beautiful traditional henna on my hands. I would most definitely recommend this, unique experience chez Amzil!",5.0
"We had lunch at Amzil's in early September. It was not only delicious but also very copious, and all the family made their best to welcome us. It really was a great time with warm people from Morocco.",5.0
"We had a very nice stay here, though the experience was a bit different than some of the reviews. Although L'houssaien was very gracious and welcoming, the experience was more akin to a moderately priced bed and breakfast than to staying with a family. The accommodations are modest but attractively appointed. The highlight for me was walking around the village in the morning and evening and getting a genuine taste of daily life in a small Moroccan village. Although I did not see it mentioned on the web site, dinner was provided every night free of charge. This is fortunate, as there are no stores or restaurants in the village. ",4.0
"I spent a night at Mr Amzil's in January. It was chosen for us by our tour company, and as we drove through the new village I wondered where on earth we were going, all breeze block and concrete square houses. When we arrived Mr. Amzil came out, very friendly, and helped our driver bring in our bags. It was a very quiet time, early Feb 2015, and we were the only ones staying. We were given a perfectly adequate room with own bathroom. Mr Amzil, despite feeling ill with a cold, was very helpful but not intrusive. We were brought tea (herbal of course) and tasty snacks - nuts and little biscuits. Supper was in the large sitting area, where the 'patio heater' was on and very welcome, it being very chilly. The guest house is attached but separate from the family home, as usual we rarely saw 'mrs', but thanked her the next morning for her delicious cooking, but Mr Amzil brought his little daughter to meet us.   The highlight was the walk around the old village the next day. All the buildings, as is common in this part of Morocco, were made of sandy clay, and as the village was abandoned for the new one - bigger houses with running water, electricity, more spacious and plentiful rooms - the old one was dissolving back into the soil from which it came. We walked around the mosque, and could go in because it was decomissioned; we walked around the fields and discussed the planted crops and palm trees. We could ask all the questions we wanted, and learned a great deal about the culture. All together, a marvellous stay.…",4.0
"I had a chance to have lunch in Amzil homestay. This place is just beautiful and amazing. Locating in a small village not quiet far from Ouarzazate, this is a place you should come if you like to know how a real-local live. This little homestay is decorated by Houssin (the owner) in a very colorful and beautiful way. I love the smell of incense in the house, so classic and peaceful. The food is cooked by his wife, very delicious, maybe the best food I have in Morocco! I really enjoyed the lunch and dessert there! Highly recommended!!!!",5.0
"I went to Morocco with some friends and we spent a night at this guest house. Houssaien received us very well, and we had a good time. Tea, Dinner and Breakfast, all really delicious! The room was very clean and comfortable.  The house has free Wifi!",5.0
This was a very interesting experience to  spend a night in a traditional Berber home.  They taught us how to prepare and cook a delicious tagine for our dinner.  Our host and hostes were most welcoming and we met their young children as well.  Our room was comfortable and traditionally decorated.  We really enjoyed the time spent there.,5.0
"What a rare opportunity to stay in an authentic Berger home. Unlike some other riads, we had heat and hot water in our traditional decorated room, As a plus,we met the family and had a cooking lesson on preparing tagine. This was a lovely experience!!!.",5.0
"My friends and I went to Morroco for a week, and we had the great opportunity to have Houssain as our tour guide. Chez Amzil is his family's Home Stay and we stayed there for a night. It was amazing!! The place is really cozy and comfortable. We had a great time there! Houssan is such a great guy, his children are very polite and his wife cooks extremely well!  I would certainly recommend this experience for people who wants to go deeper in the Moroccan culture and/or have a good time!",5.0
"This is a little off the beaten track but it is a worthwhile stopover to or from Marrakesh. Although we did not get to know the family that well, everyone was polite and welcoming and the house was charming and very clean.",4.0
"One reviewer after another has rated this lovely homestay as a 5 star experience - and we completely agree with them.  There is absolutely nothing touristy about this village, and as you approach you may wonder what you have let yourself in for.  But as with many Moroccan homes, you cannot judge this book by its cover.  You will be taken into a comfortable and appealing central living area with a number of bedrooms opening off it.  If you are travelling as a family, there will be separate bedrooms (all ensuite) for parents and for children.  We were lucky enough to find that oldest daughter Awatf was home from university for the Eid festival holidays.  What a great hostess she was, taking us all around the village and introducing us to all of her family and friends, many of whom…",5.0
"We had lunch here a couple of days ago. Our driver/guide suggested this place. We did not know what to expect because we didn't know what a homestay was but we didn't regret it. The food was some of the best we've eaten in our few days in Morocco. We had the salad, chicken tajine and fruit salad for dessert.  The host family is very kind, the owner is very accommodating, has a lot of nice stories to tell.  His children helped with serving the food. His wife did the cooking.  Place is very nice, very homey and has an authentic feel to it. Very well decorated, good for some nice pictures. The host also gave us a very good price which is about 15-20% cheaper than eating in the regular restaurants in Marrakesh even if it tasted a lot better. We also took a peek at the rooms, they…",5.0
"If you are a family with children do not miss this gem!  Admittedly, we did not know what to expect when our tour company (Your Morocco Tour) suggest that we stay at a Berber homestay just outside of Ouzazate but we are always up for an adventure.  I was even a little more apprehensive as we drove up to the village. Once the door opened, my fears melted away.  This was the cleanest, friendliest place that we stayed at during our visit.  It was spotless, the owner and his family tremendously hospitable and the food, the best we had in Morocco and very plentiful!  The owner's sons, 6 and 12, put their arms around my son's shoulders and took him to play soccer and the boys played all evening.  The teenage daughter and her cousin helped my girls (12 and 14) practice speaking French,…",5.0
Excellent restaurant with great value food & pizza's coupled with great friendly service. Just what we all needed following the Marathon des Sables. Highly recommended. Will be back if ever do the MDS again...,5.0
"The Royal is not the classiest hotel in the town, but the location cannot be beaten and the rooms are clean with comfy beds, clean linen, air con, and bathrooms with toilets that flush and showers with hot water. For the price you cannot do better, and the restaurant downstairs is a way cool place to hang out for good cheap food: we invariably have a 'crepe breakfast' there which comes with fresh oj, decent tea or coffee, a fresh galette-style pancake, cheese and jam for less than two US dollars. Right next door is Dimitri's, by far the very best of the downtown restaurants; and the market area right behind is great for an evening's stroll. You could pay more to stay somewhere else while in town, but why?",5.0
"Perfect location close to main square, souk and CTM bus station. Clean - really clean. Remember to tip the cleaning ladies if you appreciate such things.  The building has an ""open ceiling"" in the middle (I am not an expert on Moroccan architecture), so it feels very spacious and refreshing.",5.0
Clean hotel offering good and quiet rooms with shower (didn´t try more expensive rooms so writing just about this class) with sufficient space for two. Café and restaurant in groundfloor with normal prices but we preferred to have a small breakfast just across the street in cake shop with local people.,4.0
"Awesome! Thank you Ahmed your help and advice made my visit to Ouarzazate a pleasure! Thank you to all those that worked there too who made my stay very pleasurable!  It was a great location for the town and for the surrounding sights to see. Your recommendations of places to visit away from the usual ""tourist"" places will always be memorable. Especially being escorted by security at the dam for the electricity!  Mark",5.0
"Great rooms, very clean at a nice rate. Recommended. The location is nice close to the market. The cleaning ladies did really good work and where cleaning extensively when we were leaving. One of the better rooms during my stay in Morocco",5.0
"You can choose between 3 types of room: bed (60dH), bed + shower (80dH) or bed + shower + toilet (100dH), prices for 1 person/night. Very friendly staff, the rooms were clean. Nothing special, but perfect to stay for one night on a low budget. Watch out for some rooms on the side of the streets, as they can be noisy. Luckily the owner was very friendly and advised me about the most silent rooms. ",3.0
"Slept in this hotel several times - it is a simple option but a clean one, so basically all you need when travelling. The price is very competitive given the fact it is right in the center of the city. Great base for exploring the region.",5.0
The hostel is quite basic but is good if you're looking for cheap accommodation in the main street of Ouarzazate. The room had no heater and I freaked out at the beginning but then realize it was actually not really cold inside the room. They don't have booking online you can just go and ask for a room. Breakfast is not included but in the first floor there's a cafe with a pretty decent moroccan style breakfast for good price.,3.0
"Relatively decent medium-sized hotel in a riad-style building (with an open courtyard), quite well-maintained, some international guests. A bit removed from the medina, but close to a local market with street food, restaurants and tourist souvenirs, a 'convenience' store, and 25 minutes' walk away from the airport. There is a restaurant next door. One receptionist (the middle-aged black guy) defies the notion of hospitality. He switches off WiFi at night, and when a fellow guest wanted to make a Skype call, he turned it back on but said that it would be only for 5 minutes, after which he cut it off again while she was during her call. He also tries to scam you into a taxi claiming it will cost Dh 70, while in fact you shouldn't be paying more than Dh 10-20 maximum (per car, not person). The other receptionist is allegedly ok. The double/triple ensuite room is of decent size, comes with a wardrobe, toilet, washbasin and shower. No heating, meaning that in November it can get a bit chilly. Quite clean. There is WiFi, but they switch it off at night, and it doesn't quite reach the rooms anyway.…",3.0
"this small hotel has a good price and a super friendly staff. The room was clean, but very warm, and had no fan. The bathroom was small and had no box or curtain, every shower we take the floor turned into a pool! But anyway, I liked to have stayed there, simple and friendly people!",3.0

"We arrived in Ouarzazete in the evening with no accommodation booked and nowhere to stay in mind; It was also the busy tourist week between Christmas & NewYear so many hotels were fully booked. After checking out one or two hotels on the main street we made the decision to stay at the Royal.   A basic hotel with multiple room choices from singles, to doubles, triples and family rooms.  Some with bathrooms attached others without, toilets and bathroom facilites along the hall.  Accommodation is adequate if you just want a place to sleep.  The Royal is cheap and central. There are many cafes nearby all of which serve good breakfasts. The souq is within walking distance as well as banks, and a number of excellent restaurants.    If you are travelling in your own vehicle, although…",3.0
"We booked here as a pretty much last minute thing. For the price you don't expect much... toilet roll, towels etc are not provided. The shower head was not attached to the shower. The light in the room was very dull. The room didn't smell particularly pleasant... it seemed to emanate from the bathroom....  Anyway, we also had a cockroach. Location wise it was good and only a 5 min walk from the CTM bus depot. The main square is just round the back and there are plenty of eateries near by.",2.0
"150 dh for double room with private shower and wc! Great price, and good location on main road. Ideal for us as we were only stopping through on a road trip.  You will need to bring your own towels, soap and wc paper. Quite noisy as on main street, so I recommend ear plugs. Also very hot in summer (no fan).  Rooms were clean, and staff were helpful.",3.0

After asking for a room that night, we were offered one at the back (we'd read in the guides that the rooms at the front were noisy from the traffic on the main road, so go for one at the back if you can) and we extremely happy with what we got!  For 150dh per night (the cheapest place we stayed in Morocco) the room was fantastic. A decent size, excellent shower with towels in the en-suite bathroom, everything clean and comfortable.

Eating with the other guests. It felt like home We will definetely be back!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5.0
"hristophe's place was an absolute dream! We arrived after a long journey from Marrakesh to find this beautiful hideaway in the middle of the oasis. Cristophe and his staff are extremely welcoming and the room we had was of the highest standard.  We had a great time with Fouad (one of the staff members at Christophe's) as we took us to the Sahara Desert and was a fantastic guide as well! He comes highly recommended!  The food (at a 17euro/breakfast+dinner) was delicious - a wonderful blend of mostly Moroccan cuisine with a French touch was sublime. The attached restaurant is cozy and has a great atmosphere - and is exactly what one needs as the nearest supermarket is quite a ways off.  The experience was definitely more boutique-hotel like, than the traditional AirBnB format.  We are eager to return to Morocco soon and will have Christophe's place as the first on our list!  We highly recommend him to anyone who seeks some peace, great food, and extremely hospitable people…",5.0

I just want to say that Ayoub  was a fantastic host while I was at his camping ground. I also have to thank Ayoub for his incredible help.  I had a motorcycle accident in southern Morocco while riding through the Sahara Desert and smashed my collarbone which required me to fly back to Australia for reconstruction surgery.   For 6 months Ayoub looked after my motorcycle and kept am gear safe while I recovered in Australia. He did not have to do this for me. We had not meet before my bike turned up on a truck and he was kind enough to look after it for me. He looked after it like it was his own. When I return to collect my bike Ayoub put me up in one of his rooms as it was hot as hell outside because of the summer temperatures.  The room was very clean and comfortable. Thank you Ayoub for making a very stressful time manageable and keeping my bike safe.  Patrick…,5.0
Me and some friends undertook the adventure to travel Marocco by Autobus and Tent.

"Due to my parents' recommendation we stayed at Naima's and Guy's house for two nights and immediately felt at home. Naima is a great cook and she made dinner for us during our stay. We went on a day trip from Ouarzazate with our car and Guy made sure we find our way by guiding us through the city.  Especially when you arrive at night their house is not so easy to find but don't hestitate to call them. We were able to make a call from the Hotel La Vallée and Guy picked us up. Don't miss going here! It's not like staying at a hotel, it's like family.",5.0

"We drove from Marrakech to Ait Ben Haddou and had originally booked at Defat Kasbah, but they were overbooked. Ahmed was kind enough to arrange for us to stay with Rakkia at Tigmi El Janoub... and we are so pleased!!  The room is large, simply but beautifully decorated. The bathroom is simple, but functional.  What made our one night stay so pleasant was the fact that we were the only guests so the only sound to be heard was the occasional donkey braying or the adhan from the nearby minaret.   Rakkia, our gracious host, made us feel completely at ease in her very traditional Moroccan home. Breakfast was fresh and delicious complete with fresh, delicious orange juice, coffee, tea, hot bread, and assorted jams and local honey.  So very happy we stumbled upon this wonderful home!! ",5.0
"We stayed only one night on our way to Marrakech from the desert. I wish we had stayed longer. We arrived later than expected and the very friendly host provided a spectacular meal... the best tagine I had in 2 weeks of travel in Morocco... really made up for a tough day on the road. The inn is near Ait Ben Haddou but in a small village to the north so you are away from the tourist hassle... the village is in the spectacular Ounila valley which appears as a long oasis in the stark, beautiful foothills of the Atlas. The room was very comfortable as are the public rooms. The breakfast was absolutely wonderful with items we had not had at other places (including the most amazing local honey). I highly recommend... I highlight of our trip.",5.0
"After a long drive from Marrakech, we arrived at Tigmi el Janoub and felt right at home. The friendly manager gave us a choice of rooms upon arrival - all of which were lovely.  We enjoyed a hearty home cooked Moroccan diinner, and our delicious breakfast the next day was served on a roof terrace, overlooking some stunning Moroccan scenery. Location wise, it was handy for visiting the amazing Ait Benhaddou. We could have easily stayed on longer at this gorgeous place, one night didn't seem like quite enough.",5.0

"This place is truly fabulous and I would urge you to go and stay there. Beautifully decorated with lots of areas to sit. Large comfortable rooms. Only stayed 2 nights but really wish had stayed longer. The person looking after this hotel, Farid, was exceptional in showing us around the 2 villages near the hotel. We also went off on a very long walk (maybe 15 miles round trip) by ourselves going in the direction of Telouet. Incredible array of villages and friendly local people. No hassle at all. The food was not gourmet but just fine. The temperature of the shower was a bit hard to adjust. Otherwise can't think of anything negative to say.

The owner (from France but who has lived for many years in Morocco) was most hospitable. He was exceptionally friendly and courteous. Despite the fact that he didn't speak much english, and we didn't speak much french, we did not need for anything during our short stay.

Phillipe was a wonderful host and we enjoyed his company as we talked into the evening, although tiredness from traveling inevitably moved me to bed.  Our room had everything you would need and was decorated perfectly with traditional Moroccan furnishings(as was the whole house), including a beautiful hand decorated wash basin and tadelakt shower in the bathroom, all of which Phillip has tastefully created himself.

Thanks to Valérie who realized a dream of hers in building (interior design) guest house and thanks to Raja who takes excellent care of the guests I once more felt like being at home just in a different country in a different city.  The house is gorgeously decorated in authentic manor. The terrace at the top give a wonderful view of the urban and everyday life of the citizens of Ouarzazate . The rooms are spacious and lovely - only quirky and slightly tricky parts are the bathroom swinging doors to the on suit bathrooms :-).The charm of the house does not stop at the interior and a private hammam on the roof top.

One of the two nights we stayed, we were the only people there.  The food was good.  The location was good. Rooms were large and comfortable. We are glad we chose to stay there.  The only drawback we noticed was that there were shared bathrooms on each floor (rather than one bathroom in each room).  It wasn't a problem for us, as the hotel was relatively empty when we were there.",5.0
"Dar al Aafia is on a quiet dirt road, a short way off the main highway from Marrakech, away from all the touristy stuff in the center of the city. The riad is new and beautiful. The ceilings are amazing. The rooms large and comfortable. Great bathroom after our stay in a rustic village. The inner courtyard stays cool most of the day and has wifi to check your e-mail. The best part was our hostess, Raja, who couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. We enjoyed meeting her and staying here. If you want to stay in the center of town with a bunch of noisy tourtists complaining about stuff, this may not be the place for you, but I highly reccomend Dar al Aafia for anyone who wants a restful stay in Ouarzazate in a traditional riad with a wonderful hostess.

"This is not a camping or hotel review but this page wouldn`t cooperate. This is a review of the Kasbah Amridil.

Zunächst war es nur ein Campingplatz, aber nun wurde ein Block mit großen, geräumigen Zimmern angebaut.

Ganz besonders war der nette Empfang durch den Besitzer Mohamed Nassiri und seinen Bruder. Die Lage ist einfach wunderbar, direkt vor dem Palmenhain. Ich konnte mein Zimmer mit einem großen Doppelbett beziehen und auch die Dusche war bereits warm. Frisch gestärkt bekam ich dann im Restaurant ein leckeres Tajine serviert. Aber noch toller war das Frühstück am Morgen, es war gut und gerne für eine Familie konzipiert mit frisch gebackenen Pfannkuchen.

"If you look for a place where you have the feeling you arrived on a different planet, this place is for you; after 1h driving on muddy tracks, you arrive in a middle of an Oasis, next to a village of 10 houses made of mud, rocks, etc... You stay in a tent, livingstone-like, very nice design, quite luxury in fact. The whole team is really nice, professional, happy to let you rest or to take you for a trek, teach you how to cook your bread, make a couscous, meet the villagers, learn a few words of the Berbere language, etc...  I advise you to do a treck in this desert: it looks like planet Mars; the ground is very flat, everything is red, many small stones the size of an head across the land, with a few canyons around... very strange. The restaurant and the library are in a vast tent, very nice furnished. SInce this place is not a restaurant, do not expect to choose your starter or your main course, there is only one meal, take it or leave it. You'd better like couscous or Tajine!…",5.0
"As part of our package, we first went to the camp du desert a bit further south before to get here for our last 2 nights. it was the best nights we could possibly dreamt off. It is not easy to get there, that's why  we had a private transfer from Ouarzazate to the camp with Brahim, a great moroccan guide. The atmosphere here, in the heart of a palm grove is a bit unreal. You can feel all the history and the tradition of the moroccan nomades who have been living here for 2000 years. The tents are very luxurious and decorated with taste. The meals were  a delight, especially dinner under the stars of the desert. A fantatic experience overall.",5.0
"I spent two weeks in Morocco as part of a package deal. My first week in Marrakesh was great, but I was excited to move on and explore the countryside to get to know some locals that wern't so used to tourists. My family was incredibly impressed by the beauty of the campsite that blends well with the surrounding nature. On our second day, we went on a hike to the surrounding kasbahs and our guide informed us about them and introduced us to the locals we ran into along the way. The food was also pretty delicious! They know what it takes here to please tourists without compromising their Moroccan roots.",5.0
Its all you need for careless stay and moore. Rooms are really cozy and you have a true home feeling there. They have a hot shower and fridge.

We spend three days with them and it was amazing.,5.0
"Didn't stay in the actual apartments in Ouarzazate, but Felicty and Abdelhadi (owners) really saved us on our Moroccan adventure. We had been on a 4 day trip with their tour company, only to find our train to the north had been canceled. They graciously helped us find transportation, and Felicity even put us up in her apartment overnight in Rabat. We eventually made it to Chefchaouen, but wouldn't have without their help.",5.0
"Excellent value for families or groups of travellers, especially those who don't like the impersonality of large chain hotels.  The apartment we stayed in was the larger of the two and could comfortably house a sizeable family without feeling cramped. All the facilities you need are available in the apartment making it a great base if you're planning to travel around the area. The location is also very convenient. Although Ouarzazate itself is a fairly small city, the flights from Casablanca tend to arrive very late at night so it's great to be able to be travel from the airport to your hotel within ten minutes.",4.0
"There are two spacious bedrooms and a living which can host more than 3 persons. All what you need is provided and you feel like you were home. Before, I used to go in a hotel which was so expensive and not as pratical as an apartement.  The apartement is situated not far from the centre of Ouarzazate and you can find easily taxis. The place is quiet and peaceful and very clean. I have enjoyed everything during my stay and will come back soon.",5.0
"Beautifully decorated and furnished, clean and peaceful, with everything you need for a self catering break. I stayed here with my two young children in January and it was like a home from home. We had a lovely few days in Ouarzazate and the surrounding area and were able to return at the end of the day and relax. The rooms are well furnished and comfortable, there is a great salon with satelite TV, the kitchen has all the necessary basics and they have even thought of mugs! The apartments are situated in a newly built-up area of Ouarzazate, but there are many small shops to pick up bread and basics. The kasbah is 15mins walk and taxis are easy to flag-and cheap.",5.0
"The staff were lovely, very kind and welcoming, and the apartment was spotlessly clean. But unfortunately, the bathroom is VERY small, the shower was ice-cold and the shower head sprayed everywhere (broken). There were no cooking utensils - in the kitchen there is a cupboard full of saucepans that has been nailed shut! No oven, just a gas hob, so cooking full meals very difficult. Internet was patchy and slow. TV  only local channels. Location right in suburban neighbourhood - you 'stand-out' as a tourist which is a little uncomfortable. This apartment would be more suited to long-term rental to local families with their own furniture, or to backpackers as a budget overnight stop to the desert - would not recommend for family holiday.",3.0
"Dar Tuzzalt is a place where you can get in touch with the roots of the south of Morocco. The managers are very helpful, and give you tips about places to visit in and around the city, and they make all within their power to make your stay a great experience.  If you are considering a cultural trip that will allow you to experience living with a real Moroccan family, that is a must go. Otherwise, go to a monotonous hotel that will not allow you to experience the Berber culture.  I'll definitely recommend the place and will definitely re-visit them!!!",5.0
"This place is peaceful, and the hospitality you get is enough to make you wish you could stay permantly. The food is a fresh and different taste to be had, in any event they provide flavorful food which leaves you wanting to always sample their good food.

"Getting There: Arriving in Ouarzazate and finding Rosas couldn't be easier. All taxis have a flat rate of 4 dirham per person during the day and 6 dirham at night. Every taxi driver we used knew Rosas and as Ouarzazate is so small you will be there in a matter of minutes. It also has a big sign outside (unlike some accommodation in Morocco) which is above a café. The hotel is through the café, if you can't find the door then a member of staff (and all of the patrons) will point you in the right direction.   The Room: It was a huge apartment. There are only two of us and we had two bedrooms. The kitchen is simply furnished but enough for light cooking. Air conditioning was great and there was a balcony even though the amount of furniture in the room blocked its use. We had a problem with the bathroom (the toilet wouldn't stop running) and they moved us immediately to another apartment (even bigger!).   Extras: THERE IS NO WIFI IN THE APARTMENT. For those that kind of thing is important, it only works down in the café attached to the hotel. Breakfast is the best one we have had in Morocco, a choice of tea or coffee, bread with jam and butter and two chocolate pastries. It is all served in the café downstairs whenever you chose to head down.  Location: It is slightly out of the centre of town but Ouarzazate is very small and you can walk to all the key places within 15 minutes. We explored the whole town and the area around the square is where everything is located, this means you are a walk away from all Ouarzazate has to offer (plus the cheap taxi rates if you are tired).   Staff: The staff spoke limited English but this was fine as they tried to be as helpful as possible. It is a family run hotel and some of the family come to the café to use the internet and will suddenly leap up to assist you if you are looking for the hotel owners, it can be disconcerting at first to be dealing with a customer cum staff member, but it is all fine with the owners. Only one problem with the staff,  the older gentleman when we were paying for the room was reluctant to give 60 dirhams in change. We cannot decide if he was bad at math or trying to cheat us this amount but each 20 dirham note came from his hand at a snail's pace eventually him waving us away still 20 dirhams short.…",4.0
"I can recommend this hotel to those who travel by car - perhaps the entire families. The hotel is located in a residential area of town, that's why it seems not convenient for those who rely on public transport. you should walk to the city center with markets, shops and restaurants about 20-30 minutes. This is aparthotel, and I see in it its advantage. We booked double room, and got an apartment with two separated rooms, a kitchen and a bathroom with WC. In bedroom there are two beds for adults and one for children, in living room - three sofas, table, TV. The kitchen has everything you need for cooking.",4.0
"At first, on our arrival to Ouarzazate, we supposed (because of its very cheap rate - 20 euros for double-room) that the residence is located quite far. But then it turned out that to the city center with markets, shops (among them two supermarkets; in one of them named ""DIMETRA"" they even sell alcohol, although at expensive prices) there is just a kilometer. It was a surprisingly nice hotel - probably the best of those we have stayed in during this trip. Spacious rooms, new furnishings and equipment, and fully equipped kitchen. However, the kitchen, as now I understand it, belongs to two rooms at once. And our good impression was explained by the fact that there only several guests in the hotel and we got in fact  quadruple instead of booked double-room.  Disadvantages? The breakfast like in all Morocco was a little bit poor (although breakfast represents a huge advantage for the aparthotel ). And in order to have dinner, we should walk this  kilometer to the city center and back.…",4.0
"We stayed for one night on a road trip round Morocco, and were very pleasantly surprised indeed, given that we'd only paid 10 euros each, with breakfast. Arriving in late afternoon we didn't have the chance to look round the local area for shops or restaurants - the bar under the accommodation is more of an internet café than a source of food - and drove into town to find a place to eat, the residence being at the edge of town. The location isn't very impressive, but once inside it's a different story - clean, well furnished and very comfortable - our apartment had two bedrooms, a sitting room, and a fully fitted and equipped kitchen. Our only quibble was that there was no A/C in one of the bedrooms, and had the weather been hotter that could have been a problem. I'd suggest this residence might be best for those with their own transport because of its location; also be aware that the accommodation starts on the second floor, and there's no lift but then, all being over 60, we notice these things!! The excellent breakfast before we set off for Marrakech totally belied the low cost, and we left with pleasant memories of our stay, calling at the old medina/Kasbah on the way out of town - don't miss that, it's most impressive!.…",4.0
"We stayed 4 nights at RR. The rooms were actually apartments with all necessary facilities and it all seemed newly built.

The staff was very friendly and service minded, and also flexible with the serving hours for breakfast, something we appreciated very much since we were going for long trips from early morning till late evening. RR is located on the outskirts of Ourzazate but that is not a problem due to the limited size of Ouarzazate. It is, in fact, a mere 15min. walk from the CTM bus station.",4.0

"This ""hotel"" was chosen for it's location for bird watching. I never expected luxury in this part of the world and am used to basic accommodation but this place is worse than dreadful. The shower was covered in mold, the basin tap was not fixed properly so it spun round rather than turn on. There was no hot water. The bed had bed bugs which covered me in bites during the night. The food was very limited and the bread not fresh. I could go on but the worst aspect was that the staff simply could not care less. They made no attempt to understand the problems and only forced a pleasant expression when a tip was expected, at all other times they were surly. This place does not deserve any tourist money.",1.0
"We were a party of 30 Univeristy students with a confirmed booking (since September). After a tiring day we were all keen to settle into our hotel. We were kept waiting and told that some of our rooms were not available - the women in our party should all share single beds. The owner appeared cross and shouted at me in Arabic - I didn't take it personally since I was not organising the trip and in any case I didn't understand  what he was saying. We packed our suitcases back in the minibuses and found a much more pleasant hotel in Dades town, clean with excellent food and wonderful drummers who entertained us. All my other experiences in Moroccan have been friendly and very enjoyable, so this was quite a shock.",1.0
"Take as you find, but I personally never go to this hotel.  Not that I have stopped there, although we tried.  We were a  party of 30 adult education students with a confirmed booking.  On arrival, we were told that a number of our rooms were not available and that the women in our party should all share single beds.  The owner was most ""vocal"" when we complained; we were fortunate that we did not understand his Arabic.  We moved on and found a hotel in Dades town with pleasant staff, clean and with excellent food.",1.0
"Nice hotel at a great location. We had a room on the second floor to the left with a nice view of the valley. The room was ok, nothing special but clean enough. We ate outside which was nice. In the morning it was just a short walk through a pretty village to the river and the fields. The lobby has WiFi. Recommended for a short stay to visit the pretty Dades valley.",4.0
"This was the worst hotel in a serie of hotels we visited in Maroc. All the rest of the hotels were fine. The owner is not interested in his customers, only in the money they bring in. It's cold inside, dirty rooms (exp. the shower). Breakfast is very limited with old bread of the day before. And the Tajine was the most expensive we came across in whole Maroc and definiatly not the best. Avoid.",1.0
"My family stopped here on a three day trip to the desert.  We were expecting a simple, decent place to spend the night, but we were extremely disappointed with our stay here.  The worst thing was the large amount of mold (black spots) in the shower.  My wife and kids would not shower in it.  I am used to roughing it, but even I was hesitant to get in the shower and stood on a towel.  The shower and lack of heat in the room on a cold February night made for a miserable night here.  The positive aspects of the hotel are the nice location in the Dades gorge, a friendly staff, and a nice meal in the hotel restaurant.  Some people may have no problem with the hotel, but it will help to know what to expect when you arrive.",2.0
"Only my second ""poor"" rating ever (the other is also in Morocco).  But compared to the other, maybe this is a ""poor plus"" - not all bad.  Room had lovely view and balcony - we actually washed clothes and hung them out to dry in the late afternoon sun.  Room does have a bit of furniture other than the bed.  Several people in our group had problems with bathroom facilities - our shower did not drain (or VERY slowly).   We got to the hot water early - it did not last.  There was a door on the bathroom, the shower was down a little step but no curtain.  Upon insistent request, we were given a remote for the heater.  At first we couldn't get it on, but with a repeat visit from the hotel staff it worked just fine.  Restaurant served good dinner and simple continental breakfast.  There is a bit of local walking near the hotel, but not too interesting.  Very nice gift shop off the lobby.  WiFi available in lobby.…",2.0
"We stayed here on the first night of a three-day desert trip with Moroccan Views.  We arrived after dark on December 30, and it was cold outside.  It was just as cold inside the hotel, which left the door open and had nothing to heat the inside, at least in the lobby.  Same for the room, which was freezing cold, and had no heater.  Our room had a closet with one broken door, and it was filled with dirty clothing--we couldn't imagine why.  There were no towels or soap in the bathroom, and no hot water.  None.  We had dinner in the hotel restaurant, which at least was warm inside.  Afterward, we went to the banquet room where some of the staff played drums and sang Berber songs, and danced, all of which was great fun.  There was even a traveler with a didgeridoo who joined in.  Sleeping, however, was torture.  It was so cold that I kept waking up, thinking that my feet were in ice buckets.  I tried everything to get warm, but never did.  Miserable night in a miserable hotel, apart from the singing and dancing.  Stay away from this dirty, freezing torture chamber.…",1.0
"El hotel está a unos 20 min a pie de la estación de Supratours. Y a 10 min del centro con restaurantes. Viajando en pareja nos costó 20 euros cada noche por dos camas separadas (aun después de habérselo bajado), sin desayuno, no había nadie otro huésped en el hotel, el baño estaba sucio (estaba mojada la tabla del wc...) y tuvimos que pedir 2 veces papel higiénico porque no había. Para pasar una noche no está tan mal, pero no lo recomiendo. El dueño nos quería vender todo el tiempo alguna excursión o lo que sea, así que eso también se hacía pesado.",3.0
"A basic place to sleep.Functional bed and toilet. Manger very friendly and helpful who included breakfast in the price after a little persuasion. Location between bus station and town, convenient for both",3.0
"Hotel a evitar. Foi o pior sitio onde já ficamos, os quartos são sujos, a casa de banho um horror. O chuveiro esta pendurado na parede sem nenhuma protecção molha o wc todinho. A única cois razoável é o pequeno almoço. Tendo em conta as opções no local é um hotel a evitar!!",1.0
"For their prizes this hotel was very good. Clean, good bed and Air conditioned but no paper for wc and no towels.  But dont buy anythink to eat. We payed 8 euros for an omelette, a salade and a coke. Not good.",3.0
"Nous avons payé la chambre 200 dirhams ( environ 20 euros) avec sanitaire dans la chambre et eau chaude. Accueil très sympathique. L'hôtel est tout près du centre ville. L'hôtel n'est pas luxueux vu le prix, mais pour une nuit c'était convenable.",3.0
We came here on a lovely spring day to have lunch on the outside porch. We started with a chopped salad with hard boiled eggs and olives served with freshly baked bread with olive oil. Then we had beef tagine followed by slices of fresh oranges and bananas with a small sprinkle of cinnamon. We took a ride to see the fantastic Dades gorges and came back for some fresh tea and handmade Moroccan cookies. The bathrooms were very clean,5.0
"One of the worst hotels we have ever stayed in the world! The room was extremly cold and wet, the bed hasn't got fresh leaning, we foud a lot of sombodys hair. The bathroom was dirty, never cleaned. Smelly shower.  When I tried to ask for a kit to switch the heating on, manager was rude and let us pay 10 euro.  Food was simple and bad. We didn't choose the hotele, because we bought a trip for Sahara. Avoid!!!",1.0
We stayed here one night as part of our Gorges Dades detour in Morocco. What an amazing place and great staff. Being vegetarians we were struggling for options at times - not here. The chef prepared some excellent veggie food and it was a very nice 4 course dinner. There isn't a lift to get here but the staff helped carry our bags upstairs.,5.0
"One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. The bed was dirty, old & uncomfortable and I woke up covered in flea bites. The bathroom was filthy with constant dripping water. When I complained to the manager he was rude and arrogant. And they charge 80 dirham for a dreadful berber omelette - twice the price I paid anywhere else in Morocco. Avoid!",1.0
"L'hotel si presenta carino sia all'esterno che all'interno. Siamo arrivati qui tramite la guida Lonely planet senza prenotazione e ci hanno sparato subito una cifra fin troppo alta per la media marocchina! Alla fine siamo riusciti ad avere una camera doppia con bagno e mezza pensione a 350 DH.  La mattina abbiamo scoperto che non c'era acqua calda, l'abbiamo fatto presente al personale e ci ha detto che dopo 20 minuti sarebbe arrivata... non era proprio caldissima ma una doccia si poteva fare! Cena con zuppa e tajne colazione con fagottini (un po' duri) e pane, marmellata e burro.  Ottima posizione per una bellissima passeggiata nelle gole!",3.0
"Ontbijt oude koekjes, bedden niet opgemaakt, raam kapot, wc loopt door, avondeten slecht, service minimaal, het slechtste hotel waar ik in 15 jaar verbleven heb, schande! Sla dit hotel alsjeblieft over!",1.0
Estivemos nesse hotel antes de irmos para o deserto de Merzouga! O staff é maravilhoso! O café da manha é muito bom também e o lugar em que servem o café da manhã é espetacular! Com uma vista linda da cidade! Os quartos sao bem equipados! Otima decoracao! ,5.0
"Os quartos são simples, mas bonitos (decoração típica da região). Não há aquecedores em todos os quartos e a água do chuveiro não é aquecida. Os atendentes não são nem um pouco cordiais. O único ponto positivo é a típica beleza de suas instalações.",2.0
"Smelly shower which took ages to drain away. I dread to think what detritus was blocking the shower drain. Cold room with very cramped space. If you are desperate for a room for the night, this could be the place for you.",2.0
マラケシュ発のサハラ砂漠の2泊3日ツアーに参加した際の1泊目でお邪魔しました。サハラエクスペディションというツアー会社です。 こぢんまりしたホテルで、部屋は狭かったですが、あまり気になりませんでした。ツアーにホテルでの夕食、朝食も含まれており、美味しかったです。,4.0
